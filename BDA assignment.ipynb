       " 'Review': {'0': '  Dubai to Manchester. Specifically chose this flight so that we could travel on the A380. Very disappointed. Boarding was OK and we were in seats 12E/F. Seats were a little narrow and widthways was restricted, nowhere to rest your elbows unless you used the bulkheads on either side, The floor ahead of the seat had a ridge in it which made it uncomfortable to stretch your legs out. Plane was 30 minutes late leaving due to one runway being out of use. Cabin service was very poor and disjointed. Starters were served and the mains did not arrive for twenty minutes. We were not offered tea or coffee after the meal and had to ask twice for it to be served, I gave up in the end. Times must be hard on Emirates; only one chocolate between us! The bar area at the rear of business cabin is the place to go if you want a drink, at least you get one there eventually. The pilot managed to make up the lost time and arrived in Manchester bang on time. Much prefer the A340 or Boeing 777 to this plane. We have the same trip booked later this year and I am wondering if I can change to another flight to avoid the A380.',\n",
       "  '1': \"  Melbourne to Auckland. This was my second trip on this route with the same airline, and the biggest difference was the service from the Cabin Crew. The morning started with a visit to the Emirates Lounge, an excellent decision. Boarding once again was chaotic, no specific lines indicating Economy, Business or First. No one knew where to go and the Ground Team just did nothing to put order in place. When we were airborne, the onboard service started and I immediately felt the FA's were not as personal compared to my previous experience. The all seem too busy with getting the job done, rather than taking the time to engage with passengers. Food and beverages were average, though the portions can definitely increase in size. The seat was comfortable and, with blankets and pillows distributed to all passengers. On a good note, the IFE was fantastic as the amount of content can keep you entertain for hours. Overall, customer satisfaction really needs to be evaluated.\",\n",
       "  '2': \" Bangkok to New York via Dubai. Very unfortunate experience on my latest Emirates flight. I'm a Skywards member that flew in late February 2017 and had a poor experience. Later I made a complaint via email including the details. They took more than 5 weeks to reply and then just told me it never happened. From what I understand, this is par for the course with their customer service. I'm horrified by the customer service for this top-rated airline. I won't be flying them again.\",\n",
       "  '3': '  Sydney to Amsterdam via Dubai. I made a seat reservation 2 months in advance and on arrival they took my ticket and handed me a new one with an aisle seat instead of the booked window seat without saying anything. I only noticed once I was looking for my seat. After the flight I claimed my miles for the flight online but when booking my next flight now I saw they were not added and when contacting Emirates they told me there was no way for me to still receive those miles even if I know I claimed them within the given time frame. These things should not happen if you pay extra for a better airline. The staff however, is nice and helpful.',\n",
       "  '4': '  Tokyo Narita to Casablanca via Dubai. I really appreciated my flight with Emirates. The seats were really comfortable and the food was very tasty. Altough the ground service was not very good. The inflight staff was helpful and kind and it was really good.',\n",
       "  '5': '  Flight turbulence, both ways, was terrible. The food was horribly over seasoned, the highlight being the champagne. All of that was still quite manageable. The flight back was the real fail. We picked this aircraft specifically for safety and spacing during COVID. They switched the flight the night before and left us in a bulkhead middle seat, surrounded by coughing strangers. They had an entirely empty first class section available, which they wouldn’t let us pay for or upgrade to for the flight. While speaking with customer service they were equally unhelpful. There is no service left on this airline, especially in a time where rebuilding travel and customer safety/comfort is so important. Avoid Emirates- the hype is not delivered upon!',\n",
       "  '6': \"  Horrible airline that leaves customers stranded and out of pocket. My original flight was to depart 4th April from Tokyo Haneda to Brussels via Dubai. I had a connecting Eurostar booked from Brussels to London, which is my final destination. Due to the unfortunate events at Brussels, my flight from Dubai to Brussels was cancelled. However, I was informed (with a lousy text) less than 24hrs before the first leg to Dubai. I then had to contact customer service and spent hours trying to get my flight rerouted. 1st, they wouldn't take me to my final destination which was London, nor did they offer me a reroute to bring me back to Brussels to catch my Eurostar to London. They said my ticket could not be refunded due to ticket class (when they cancelled the flight) so I could not book another flight to get myself home to London. They said the only way I could go to London with Emirates was to top up EUR700, which is ridiculous. They told me to ring back every 2-3 hours to check if I got on a rerouted flight as all forwarding flights from Dubai were overbooked (I was in a completely different timezone, had to wake up every few hours, and less than 20 hours before my first leg was to depart) and they also emphasised that if I arrived in Dubai and was not confirmed on a connecting flight (I'll be in the air, so I wouldn't know till I landed), I will have to cover my own accomodation in Dubai till a connecting flight could be confirmed. Extremely frustrated with the situation, I told them to book me on the first confirmed flight that I could get all the way from Tokyo to Paris, which resulted in me being stranded in Tokyo for 2 additional days. I also had to pay for a new Eurostar ticket back to London as Emirates would not cover it. Adding a cherry to the cake, my luggage did not arrive with me in Paris (which I did attempt to check at Dubai that the luggage did make it to the connecting plane, and I was assured it did). After much arguing, Emirates baggage staff assured me that they will send the luggage to my forwarding address directly in London. Fast forward to 13th April, rang Emirates in the past few days only to find that they didn't know where my luggage was other than it was put on a flight to Heathrow on 8th April. Yesterday, the French office told me to call Heathrow myself to look for it. After arguing with them, they then contacted their UK team and located my bag at the airport. Emirates French office customer service then told me to go to Heathrow T5 Belt XX to collect my delayed luggage. I was infuriated and instead of offering to arrange delivery to me as they had promised on the 6th April, she offered me an email address to contact to try and 'convince them to send it to me'. I don't believe they have adhered to their conditions of carriage in both instances with my cancelled flight and delayed baggage but the airline has not offered me any compensation nor apology and I am still waiting on getting my delayed luggage back from the most incompetent airline. \",\n",
       "  '7': 'Paris CDG to Dubai with Emirates. The chauffer transfer worked well, the lounge was good and I enjoyed the IFE. That is where the positives end. Check in was slow and did not feel I was warmly greeted. Greeting on the plane was neither warm or genuine compared with Singapore Airlines. The cabin crew did not engage and would not make eye contact when walking past. Had to make up my own bed. Food was average and not the best wine selection. Overall, this was not a premium experience.',\n",
       "  '8': '  Shanghai to Dubai. Fantastic crew. Emirates has never let me down with their service, be it on the ground or in the air. Very punctual chauffeur pick-up from the hotel to the airport, smooth boarding and one of the best crews ever on this flight. Super attentive and ever so helpful, I could have stayed onboard for much longer!',\n",
       "  '9': \"  Dubai to Vienna. Android App stopped working after I checked in. So my mobile boarding pass was not available through the App, and I wasn't able to change my seat. For dinner they only had turkey/chicken, no beef! That was the second time in a row this happened on that route. I will probably fly with another airline next time. Otherwise the flight was okay. Aircraft was brand new, including new thinner seats. Even the crew was flying it for the first time.\",\n",
       "  '10': \"  Islamabad to Bologna via Dubai Before booking flight, I checked the ratings of all airlines because I wanted my mother to have a comfortable flight. I won't be using this airline again.  Flight was delayed for more than an hour due to bad weather which one can ignore. However, flight from Islamabad to Dubai was ok even though the airplane was not very clean. Staff was cooperative. But as soon as we landed in Dubai, we were like stranded. There was no counter or any staff to help us or guide us. The fellow passengers were helpful enough to guide us. We had 18 hrs connecting flight to Bologna. It took us more than a hour to find the Emirates counter regarding hotel room. My mother cannot walk a lot. Finally when we found the counter and asked for hotel room, Emirates staff was rude and denied us room. Finally, seeing condition of my mother I offered to pay for the room. Even then, the woman sitting on counter said her shift was over and she wont help us out; we should wait till after 5 (our flight landed in Duabi at 3:00PM). After waiting for almost an hour the Emirates took around 1100 Dirhams from us for one night stay (visa fee included). But all this process took around 4 hrs as we reached hotel at 7:30 PM , extremely exhausted. When we thought all that was bad was behind us, the flight to Bologna turned out to be even a worse experience. The air hostesses were not cooperative at all. The rating I give for Cabin Staff Service is only because of staff in flight from Islamabad to Dubai.\",\n",
       "  '11': '  Dubai to Tokyo Narita. During the flight, I wanted to buy some duty free products. I asked three times, and each time the cabin attendant told me that the person dealing with duty free goods would come along shortly, but never did. After the third attempt, I gave up. What annoyed me more was that the breakfast service was cancelled due to turbulence, after the special meals were already handed out during the same turbulence! I had recently experienced more severe turbulence over the Atlantic, and the in flight service was not cancelled on that occasion (different airline). So I had to look on enviously at some of my fellow passengers while my own stomach was grumbling. In the end, I arrived in Tokyo after a 9 hour flight extremely hungry and with a back ache (seats seemed to be made of cardboard). The only positive thing about the flight was the in flight entertainment, which included wifi and live tv. That, however, is not enough to convince me to fly on Emirates with my own money again, particularly as I paid a 25% premium to fly on Emirates this time. Very disappointed.',\n",

At Dubai Airport I find nothing interesting and the wait is long, 5 hours or so. Once you are ready to depart for gates, we had to get in a bus for about 20 minutes and then climb a huge stairs to get into the plane. ',\n",
       "  '13': '  Good flight in general from Dubai to Bangkok, ultra-clean plane, nice toilet kit amenities, very attentive crew, plenty of movies, but no classical music. Food for such an airline miserable, with totally tasteless shrimps, and no fantasy in the menu at all. Seat not very comfortable: because of the removable screen controller, less space for elbow. Interesting also to note that all Emirates pictures show business class cabins in 2-2-2 configuration, never in 2-3-2.',\n",

During the serving of meals, it took an exceptionally long time before we were served and the steward did not provide us with the menu - only offered chicken option to us. When we probe further he mentioned that there is beef and chicken, so when we chose beef  the steward mentioned that there is only one beef option left. However I noted that in his tray there were many more beef packets in his trolley and he was serving beef options to others. ',\n",

First of all the staff took over an hour for the trays to be cleared leaving us highly uncomfortable in our seats. The hostess snapped at me when I asked for the trays to be cleared reporting that she has 400 passengers to cater for. Another staff snapped and told us we should wait when we requested for juice to eat our meal which was served an hour after everyone had eaten, as our preferred choice had .',\n",

On a last return trip flights itself were faultless - well almost - my original seat was slightly out of the shape and I had to change seats once. However my complementary Dubai Connect overnight stay was a mess - after landing in Dubai a little over 1pm I finally got into hotel room just before 6pm. I spent all time waiting in queues. Also nobody at hotel knew how and what time I'm going to be picked up in the next morning. Next morning the Hotel staff advised me to take a taxi to the airport and that the bill will be refunded by Emirates. They were wrong - Emirates customer service basically accused me of being cheat after I requested refund for the taxi. I took a taxi but apparently I had to wait for some mysterious bus Hotel staff didn't know about - I would never request the refund in the first place if I new it will turn out this way. Basically - Emirates, don't over-promise if you can't deliver.\",\n",

Got woken up for food and loved it! Arrived in Dubai, used the lounge as I'm a silver member so got a shower, ate some food and then as I was boarding for the second leg of my journey from Dubai to Newcastle I got upgraded to Business class again! It's just what I needed for my eighth flight in two weeks! Needless to say Business class was incredible, the service was flawless and I had more than everything I needed for the flight. All the flight crew were lovely. Emirates never fails to disappoint me and for all these reasons is why I choose to fly via Dubai instead of direct from London to Hong Kong with BA or Cathay.\",\n",

The cabin crew on both flights were friendly as professional. A complimentary play kit was provided to the child. Our seats in both flights were on row 44 (economy starts at row 41) so we were in front of engines allowing a very quite and comfortable flight. Entertaining system boasts loads of movies, music, video and other information (also 3 real cameras). Meals were served prior to children and other special requests menu. Tea, coffee, juices, etc, never lacking. 6hr flight were spent pleasantly thanks to the cabin arrangements, ICE entertainment and spacious seat legroom. Overall, a fantastic experience.',\n",

The flight attendents were friendly and helpful. Staff clean the restroom / shower after passanger usage. The entertainment channels offers a big variety and had many womens choices Magazines. The food is Emirates only weakness, but a meal in their lounge before departure helped. Before landing in LA, I took a shower onboard and was ready to hit LA after a very long flight.',\n",
       "  '23': '  Amsterdam to Male via Dubai. Disappointed. Somehow there is a myth that this is a great airline. Legroom is great as is the entertainment system. But with that all is said on the greatness. Flight delays are badly communicated (both to and from Dubai) and service is really poor. 2-2,5 hrs after take off you get served while having waited at the gate for 2 hrs (1,5 hrs delay) Cart is sitting in the aisle for 1,5 hrs before they start using it. No glass of water offered and on a six hour night flight you don’t wait for over two hours to serve drinks or meals. Crew not unfriendly but for far friendly. If I can avoid I won’t fly again. Maybe KLM has less legroom and entertainment but the crews are nicer and more attentive. Would advice Emirates to review training and food&beverage setup/process.',\n",

And as per my travel agent (Makemytrip.com) they are refusing to provide me a refund. The reason is not given.  The website has a poorly organized form that doesn't allow me to raise a complaint and couple of email IDs that I have written to, are unresponsive.\",\n",

Everything was good, in terms of food, comfort, service etc, I found cool the Amenities Kit, but the expectations were so high, I wouldn't say I am fully satisfied. On top, it's great it's a direct flight from Athens, but you land to Newark, not JFK, and it's a bit tricky to reach NYC very late at night.\",\n",

Not as good as some other cheaper airlines. Before there used to be 2 cabin crew pushing the trolley and serving the food, now it was only 1. Only 2 drinks service throughout the 6.5 hour flight, just 2. Rest of the time you have to ring the bell or go to the gallery to ask for drinks. The head purser wondering around the cabin with a tablet, the while flight. Why they keep needing to look at a tablet in a flight I don't know. Another cabin crew sitting down on a laptop for at least an hour. Why cabin crew need to use a laptop on a flight I don't know. The service has gone downhill, besides ICE nothing else is good about Emirates anymore. I won't be flying them anymore.\",\n",

My problem started in Dubai when I was about to take my connection flight to Philippines. I bought some duty-free items at Gatwick airport and more in Dubai Airport to take home. I wasn’t told it was Emirates policy that they assess every passenger’s hand luggage including items bought at the airport before you board the plane. The 7kg allowance prior to departure in London was more due to my duty-free shopping. I was told by the ground floor supervisor/manager that I have to reduce the weight of my hand luggage or pay $200 for extra weight or return my duty-free shopping but I refused to do so. If I don’t pay $200 or reduce the weight I would not be allowed to board the plane. I was speechless, and not expected this behaviour from staff.',\n",
       "  '29': \"  Hong Kong to Dubai. They blocked seats so when I tried to check in online 48hr before, I was stuck in the seat they assigned me. We were a family of four travelling together. We were separated in the huge A380. I cannot move our family to sit together or even close by. I called the customer service, and also raised my concern with their social media team, the feedback I got was that all passengers had already checked in by then - which was ridiculous. And they refused to help. Their staff told me, in a quite rude way, that I should've paid a lot more for a better cabin. Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me. I asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengers/seats on board, and the flight attendant, at first, said that this should be expected by passengers, and asked if I wanted to have cup noodle instead. Until later she said that was a mistake. She then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staff's meal but I can take it (any staff will have no meal during the flight?) I refused. Later on when they started to collect left-overs, miraculously, the flight attendant 'found' one meal and wanted to offer to me. This is disgusting. This is simply the worst experience ever.\",\n",
       "  '30': \"  I need to cancel my flight, but I didn't receive the confirmation email and didn't know my reservation code. I wasted 3 phone calls only to wait 30+ minutes in total without reaching an operator. By chance, a reminder email contained the reservation code, so I request to cancel through their form. It's been more than a week and no reply has arrived yet. The flight date is near, so I'm trying to change the date, at least, to take time. But there are no options for the same price (it should be free of charge).\",\n",
       "  '31': \"  Since it was sudden sandstorm on Sunday 14August 2022,our flight was delayed from Bahrain and then Dubai too. Wen we arrived Dubai Airport then Emirates staff gave us Boarding passes and meal vouchers for another rebooking which was 6 hours later and I asked for lounge or some waiting areas from the staff since I carrying 1 month infant with me along 1 child, she denied saying that lounges are all occupied because all flights are delayed. I again understand that lounge may not be available but she could have shown some empathy and could have tried from her end to facilitate us by saying let me check if possible. I was not informed that there will be no announcements on this airport and she did not even tell that your gate may be in another building for which you will have to go by bus or metro which takes another 30-40 minutes at least. Somehow I found a place to feed my baby which was quite far but concourse B was mentioned on my Boarding pass so I thought its near only we went to relax n feed my baby and later our gate was changed to another building and I did not know it will take such long time to reach there. Running through the way we couldn't manage it to the gate, we missed that flight too. I believe Emirates staff should communicate with the passenger clearly about the important information specially when someone like me who is going on Dubai Airport first time. I could get direct flight from Bahrain to Delhi but I wanted my family to experience the service Of Emirates and they experienced the worst experience, partially because of bad weather Delays and partially because of staff's miscommunication or no interest to facilitate the passenger with special need or request. \",\n",
       "  '32': '  After 1 month in Thailand and the prospect of coming home to rainy Scotland, I decided to treat myself and upgrade my original economy ticket to business class. Okay I\\'ll get all the positives out the way first. Great lounge at BKK, fully stocked with drinks and all the food I had was very tasty and prepared to a high standard. Seat and all the amenities that come with it were spot on, this is for the A380. The B777 is a more cramped affair altogether, so if you can, fly on the A380 - this applies to economy as well. I loved relaxing at the A380 bar area, watching the football on the big screen, whilst enjoying a freshly made cocktail, bliss! Now the negative, yes, just one, but it\\'s a biggie and that would be the service. Now, don\\'t get me wrong, there were some very pleasant FA\\'s, albeit a bit false but as for the others it\\'s the reason I won\\'t fly Emirates again. After dinner I had a full glass of champagne in front of me, the FA tried to snatch it away, I don\\'t understand this and why would you not ask the customer if they are finished? Needless to say, I snatched it back, much to the FA\\'s annoyance, forgive me for wanting to finish my drink when I\\'m paying good money. Another point is the staff just hanging around the bar towards the end of the flight, as thought it was their own staff room, I wanted to just chill and spend the last couple hours of my flight reading my book but this just totally put me off. I work in hospitality myself and believe those areas are for the customer and the customer only not for staff to drape themselves over. Upon arrival at the lounge in Dubai, I gave my ticket to receptionist and as I was off a flight and a bit tired I made the heinous mistake of going the wrong way \"Where are you going sir\" was said to me in the tone of \"what are doing you complete and utter buffoon\", not pleasant in the slightest, such a sour character and one you wonder why bother working with the public? So in a nutshell, great food, IFE, seats etc etc. But very, average service, bordering on downright rude at times. For this reason I\\'ll be trying Singapore in future and avoiding Emirates entirely. It\\'s a bad day when a low cost carrier like Easyjet are miles ahead of you in the service department.',\n",
       "  '33': '  I bought an economy ticket to Cairo but the service was very poor, is totally different what you see on publicity and advertising spots. The cabin crew were not professional.

The free wifi, was not working for the way DXB to CAI so I was so disappointed really. ',\n",

I would definitely fly with Emirates again.',\n",

The cabin crew was very nice and friendly, the seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in economy class, and the economy toilets were quite large. I had plenty of room to move around the toilets, and they had air freshener in there. The seats were comfy with lots of leg room, and the blanket they provided was quite long. When it was dark outside, they had little \"starry\" lights on the roof of the cabin to mimick the night sky. ',\n",

The service on board both ways included two full meals, nice reusable amenity kits with shades, earplugs, socks and toothpaste/toothbrush, the seats were comfortable, and the bar service featured top-shelf brands. The in-flight entertainment system was also top notch, with cameras built in to the front of the plane to provide you with a cockpit view. Economy passengers are also offered a certain amount of free wifi, which was more than enough to communicate with friends and family on the ground to inform them of my flights progress. If all of that is not enough, Emirates allows economy passengers to check in 2 bags for free!',\n",

No Priority boarding, No pre fight drinks offered, no enhanced meal service, no separation of section resulting in long queues for the bathroom from others in Economy. On arrival into UK no priority baggage collection. As a frequent traveller of this service with other airlines the offerings from Emirates fall severely short. Its a shame as the seat was comfortable and if all the missing elements were there would convert me to continue to use Emirates airlines for all my travelling requirements. I hope that these offerings will be addressed in the very near future as I felt a little cheated by paying for the upgrade with no real enhancement of service apart from a seat!',\n",

We boarded the flight at Newcastle and found our seats were not the ones I had booked back in March! I told a member of the cabin crew and she said she would get her supervisor that didn't happen! So when we arrived in Krabi minus our luggage because that was left in Bangkok due to the late arrival our our Dubai flight I emailed Emirates only to be told it could have been operational reasons we were bumped, but I feel really strongly that we are being fobbed off by them. Why bother giving you the option to book seats then move you anyway. What makes another passenger better than me and why should they get the seat I'd booked all those months in advance. I have since replied to them and asked the question again. I think the cabin crew are not as attentive as they used to be either. I know to some people the seat saga is petty but it's a big thing to me. All I hope is we get the seats we booked on our return flights. I will not say I won't fly with them again but it has made me think there maybe better airlines out there to try.\",\n",
       "  '39': 'Emirates once more offered a fantastic product, to bring me from Dubai to Frankfurt. The experience started with this unique Emirates chauffeur-Service, dropping me off at Dubai airport, just some steps away from a smooth check-in. Security and passport-control were easy and the lounge outstanding. It is huge, more like a First Class Terminal. It is important to keep in mind, that the airport is quite big, it took 15 minutes to walk from Check-in to the lounge and 15 minutes from the lounge to the gate. Boarding was well organized and efficient. This time, there was no airbridge to the upper deck, but this was not a problem, as the A380 was not fully booked. Priority boarding made it easy to get on the aircraft. Service was outstanding and the crew great, cheerful and friendly. Even when you did not have a meal at the lounge, it is nearly impossible to taste all the delices of the menu. Meal service is on demand, whenever you want it. Comfort is excellent, not only because of the shower and the seat/bed. This aircraft is so quiet! Onboard Wifi worked well during 2/3 of the flight, 500 MB for 1 USD is a fair deal. At Frankfurt, priority delivery of luggage (own belt for First an Business) worked well and with a waiting chauffeur-service, the way home was as easy as it could get. The not really cheap price was nevertheless more than ok for a high-end travel-experience with this unique bling-bling-feeling.',\n",

The seafood meal of chargrilled salmon was delicious and accompanied by yet another wine. After dinner coffee was accompanied by a wide range of liqueurs. Cabin staff were regularly coming through the cabin to offer drinks and to check after passenger comfort and finished with ice-cream about an hour before landing. The other thing to mention is the 'assisted passenger service' which was superb at both ends with a helper staying with you from check-in to the aircraft door and again from aircraft door to pick-up transport and then actually refusing a tip.\",\n",

Imagine that I am a platinum customer and now I ended up sitting on a broken seat close to the toilet after asking to change a seat that has no window and no space for arm 18K, but nobody dare to advice! The plane used to Cape Town, is a very old 777, full of scratches with broken seats. Overall Emirates makes nice a video, advertising and promising the Emirates experience that in reality is to fly in substandard plane and the level of service Now the same of a mainstream airline. Obviously you still pay Emirates price. On top of this they are totally careless about frequent flyer, so If you fly for business choose other airlines.',\n",

The check in staff were able to book our luggage through to our final destination (Faro) but not us! This created a bit of a problem for the TAP staff at Lisbon. On boarding the cabin crew were chatting among themselves in the galley areas and there was no-one to welcome us to our normal (47K) seat in the rear cabin. There was a noticeable tension and seemed to be a lack of teamship amongst the crew with false smiles rather than the genuine ones of the outbound crew. Continental breakfast was served but the coffee/tea forgotten - our call bell ignored and when my wife went to ask for coffees she was told \"okay but it will be cold\". After this they disappeared into the galley areas for 5 hours, occasionally rushing through the cabin but ignoring our call bell when we fancied a drink before lunch which was then served 1.5 hours before landing meaning that it was rushed - coffee and wine were being offered at the same time and they wanted to clear trays before we had even finished the main course (which to add to our dismay was tough, grisly beef). The whole service seemed to lack leadership which comes from the cabin supervisor - so if anyone from Emirates reads this I would hope they investigate. On the good side the flight was on time, seat comfortable and flight crew informative.',\n",

I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn't check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her the Supervisor came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said your other bag is heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that. I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It looked like that other staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior.

I had a 20 hour layover in Dubai on my return and Emirates was to provide me hotel and meals in Dubai on my scheduled return date of November 14. However, even though I used the exact same flight combination for my return from TVM to Dubai and Dubai to DFW on November 8, Emirates refused to provide me hotel and meals at Dubai. I had to pay an extra $85 for hotel and approximately $50 for meals. As it is, I paid $1,609.54 originally for the ticket which I thought was overpriced and an additional $375 in penalties and fare difference for changing my return date. I am left wondering whether Emirates is in the business of providing air transportation or of highway robbery.

Is that a customer issue or fault? Seats are extremely hard and uncomfortable. This is our first and last travel on Emirates.',\n",
       "  '52': '  London to Dammam via Dubai. I am a regular traveler with Emirates due to business, I have noticed a decline in cabin standards over the past year. On this particular trip I requested Lactose free meal, the cabin crew gave me a meal that did not have my seat number. I advised what I had requested and was told you can eat it as it is just a sandwich, when I inquired what was in it they did not know.',\n",
       "  '53': '  Travelled last month to Mauritius via Dubai from Manchester and returned back a few days ago. The flights were comfortable in general. Service was good, though some of the cabin crew appeared tired and not happy when requests were made. The A380 is a great aircraft and the journeys made did other make me tired. Food was OK, though concerned that the quality has somewhat changed as opposed to previous flights with the airline. Some meals were nice, though could have been better in some aspects. The WiFi service is ad-hoc and did not always work properly. This could be explained by virtue of the fact that there are Internet restrictions when flying over certain countries. No complaints otherwise.',\n",
       "  '54': ' The one area that consistently disappoints with Emirates is their service. I have consistently experienced poor service flying Business class with them. I\\'ve often found their economy class staff service to be much better surprisingly. I just cannot understand how an airlines that is so highly rated cannot get their service right especially in Business class. Approached the Business Class check-in person in Dubai with my wife and child and we were greeted by a grumpy lady gesturing to place our passports on the desk. No smiles, no conversation nothing, did her work, handed out our boarding passes and motioned us to the direction of the gate. Not a word was spoken. I was expecting to board directly from one of the gates at the business class lounge as generally is the case with A380 flights but we were motioned to go down to the gate and board from the gate with everyone. At the gate there was no separate boarding for business / first class, waited in the long line with everyone. Once we got into the flight, we settled down onto the amazing business class seats and was looking forward to a comfortable flight. Just then a flight attendant bumped into another attendant who was serving champagne to a customer and the whole contents of the tray spilled over on to me. I was soaked in champagne before the 14 hour journey to Toronto had even started. A quick word of apology was muttered and I was handed a towel to clean up and was directed to the washroom where some more towels were handed out while my seat was being cleaned. I returned back to my seat to find that champagne was still pouring out of the creases and cracks of my seat. I asked for one more towel and never got it. Later during the flight I asked for a headphone for my child and the response I got was \"One was placed on every seat\". That\\'s it. I had to get one myself from another unoccupied seat. Every time the same lady came to clear my table / seat of any clutter or finished meal, I was motioned to place them on her tray. It was like she couldn\\'t be bothered to reach out and pick them up. So I spent the flight collecting things around my seat to place it on her tray every time she came. The whole experience was really shocking especially after the fortune you had coughed up for the experience. Emirates boasts of taking extra effort to take care of children, my 3 year old\\'s presence was not once acknowledged, the only gesture was a child\\'s goodie bag being handed out. We also experienced similarly disappointing service at the Emirates check-in counter at Toronto airport on our way back to Dubai. No smile, no word. I asked if the flight was full to which I got the reply \"Wait I am trying to read something here\". Never ended up getting an answer. The service on the flight (Economy class this time) was however excellent. I commended them on their efforts. Makes me wonder though why the such a difference in service between the two classes? If at all one should experience better service for business class yea? I have encountered similar experiences in previous flights with them as well - generally rude and snobbish flight attendants in business class while the opposite is true for economy class.',\n",
       "  '55': '  Great and consistent service given by the crew, especially the steward serving the cabin from row 24 till 36. He helped with finding space in the overhead bins for cabin bags, was very friendly and motivated, and provided excellent service. During the entire flight he paid attention on passengers wearing their face mask, and made remarks to the ones not wearing it. In the past (before Covid19), I experienced some flights where service was lacking and unsatisfied, but this was a pleasant experience. Only negative point is the self check-in at Dubai Airport. People are guided to self check-in machines, also elderly and less frequent flyers, big families, and it takes very long time to have their check-in completed. Especially when they have excess baggage and already half of the bags have been send through. After completing check in, still have to queue up for passport and PCR verification at another Emirates desk, which makes the self check-in less convenient. Nevertheless great experience again.',\n",
       "  '56': ' Not close to what we expected. We now understand why Emirates is not number 1 anymore. We are frequent travellers going to various locations, always Economy. The flights with Emirates from Frankfurt to Male via Dubai and same way back were pretty \"interesting\". On all flights we were pretty confused that the blankets we used to keep us warm were taken away before landing, same counts for the earphones. (We had our own but even them they wanted to take away, crazy). The Cabin crew was not pretty helpful and especially soft drinks were not offered often enough, even on request we were simply ignored, maybe because of being Economy guests. Highlight was that the cabin crew lady poured me with Mango juice and did not even say a word. The food experience was average, other airlines offer much better food from a quality perspective and also from the options you have. Entertainment was pretty good.',\n",
       "  '57': '   First time flying Emirates, was expecting a lot because this airline has a good name. Unfortunately the facts are different. Attendants on 3 of the 4 legs a have flown with them look as they are very tired. Making eye contact, heads are turned away, being in the aisle for a short moment, I was literally pushed aside by a staff member walking up and down the aisle. Meal time was too short, 1 time I got my breakfast 30 minutes before landing, 5 minutes later they tried to collect my meal again. The meals itself were overall good and the food was enjoyable. Ground services in Amsterdam and Dubai were accurate and friendly. Overall I booked my next vacation in December and avoided this airline. The feeling I got from Emirates was that I am not welcome and passengers are a burden.',\n",
       "  '58': \"  After traveling on long distances routes with various carriers over the last 5 years I decided to go back and revisit Emirates in the A380 transiting in Dubai. I'm happy I did. Flew Hong Kong to Madrid via Dubai. Emirates seem much improved to me. The upper deck in the A380 is peerless, but there are a number of things that set Emirates apart now, in my opinion. The ground staff and transit interactions in Dubai, at least in Business, are just head and shoulders above anything else. The Business Departures is actually separate and you enter the plane directly from the lounge: stress-free, anyone? No lines, no hassle, no hysteria. The synergy is seamless. I love Cathay and Hong Kong, but they don't have that. JFK or Heathrow? Dream on. I recently had an appalling transit experience with Turkish in Istanbul and I would say this flight on Emirates showed how much more professional and logistically advanced Emirates are than that overrated carrier. Not to mention that the Dubai lounges are huge with great food and smiling staff. On board: again, top service, attentive and unfailingly good-humored. The walnut panelling is really nice, the cabins are soothing and elegant. The inflight screens are huge and crystal clear, wide selection of multi-lingual movies, including new releases from Korea and Japan. Food was superb, and I mean superb. For the first time in years I actually enjoyed the entire experience of a 14 hour flight. Moreover, they offer free limo service in every city you arrive in: they don't botch the reservations and the guys are waiting for you at the gate. What! Given that their prices are average, I would say Emirates now outclass almost every other long distance carrier if we except the Japanese, Korean Air, Singapore and Cathay, and maybe Quantas. But do any of these offer the add ons and extras that Emirates offer? I'll have to try a few of them in the near future. However, for the time being I am switching my allegiance to Emirates because they have cracked the nut on this one. Certainly, going East-West via Dubai there's no competitor.\",\n",
       "  '59': '  Melbourne to Cape Town via Dubai. My wife and I were unable to select a seat on our flight from MEL-DXB-CPT until about 48 hour before the flight unless we pay $30 for each sector. We decided against and selected seats 48 hours before the flight. The real problem arose on our return journey from HDS-JNB-DXB-MEL. The HDS-JNB flight was with South African Airline and yet I was unable to checkin the Emirate flight from JNB-DXB-MEL. Emirates website directed us to check in via South African Airlines although the bookings confirmation numbers are different. I did online check in with South African Airline website but they insisted that I can only checkin the Emirate flights with Emirates website. Anyway we arrived in Johannesburg JNB and went to the Emirates check in desk. I explain to the check in person that we require an aisle and the next seat so that we do not have to disturb the next passenger for toilet break. After all explanation she gave us a window and middle seat. She disregarded our request. To top it up she directed our bags to MEL but will not and could give us the boarding pass from DXB to MEL. She stated that there is a regulation and restriction to do so. Surprisingly two other Australians who were checking in in the next counter were giving boarding passes with seat allocation all the way to Melbourne. When we landed in Dubai I went to Emirates service and requested boarding passes and the appropriate seats. To our surprise we were given two seats (under the same booking number). Mine was in row 66 and my wife in row 88. We were totally separated. We were told that the flight was over booked. No amount request and pleading was considered. We were told to go the the boarding gate and ask for different seats but there is no guarantee that we will be together. The Emirates staff were rude and acted like robots. Finally at the boarding gate we were given a window and middle seats. We had to constantly disturb the person sitting in aisle seat for toilet visits. The whole experience with Emirates ground staff was a shocking experience.',\n",

We found out from a fellow passenger that the flight was not confirmed. I tried calling and contacting them online but both channels were too busy. We finally went to talk to the staff who couldn't confirm when we will be flying out. They told us that they could not confirm about our connecting flight in Dubai to Bangkok too. A two-to-three-days wait was probable. We finally had to cancel the flight and bought a new last-minute ticket from Qatar to get back home. We tried to get compensation on extra hotel charge and airfares but the airline is not taking any responsibility. Extremely poor management and definitely no sense of responsibility from the airline.\",\n",

I could check the Economy menu, so I knew what it was, and it was pretty inedible. Staff on board were initially adamant that I was having a Business Class meal, but later relented. Emirates seemed unwilling to acknowledge the issue, offered me 10000 points (hardly worth it) and noted it was possible to 'source a meal from a different section of the aircraft', without an apology for the mistake. So watch out - Emirates seem to think this practice is acceptable.\",\n",
       "  '64': '  We were flying from Mumbai to JFK via Dubai on 7th June, 2022. When we were checking in, looks like only 1 cabin baggage is allowed (and no personal item) while you are flying out from India. This was not the case when I was flying in from the USA. Looks like this is the rule only from India. We were charged a very high price of 35,000 Rupees for just 2 personal items which was a backpack and handbag. We had no choice but to pay. This was unheard of before. Disappointed as a customer while flying out from India.',\n",

Flying to Sydney this year it’s clear to see an awful lot of cost-cutting at play with the Economy Class product. While EK will get you from A to B in relative comfort, gone are the days of personalised service, care for passengers or the little perks that used to make travelling with them so great – with items such as hot towels having been ditched. It’s a shame to see EK go down this route, but it’s unlikely they’ll be my go to option in future – unless the price is right.',\n",

There was a delay on the last leg back to Heathrow due to a technical issue and whilst the communication could have been better we were given a food voucher which was very much appreciated. The issue was rectified reasonably quickly and the captain made up time en route so we arrived late but not excessively so. Cabin crew were efficient although varied depending on the sector flown. Generally they were cheerful and friendly. Food was fine and the IFE has a huge amount of choice. Despite the delay on the last leg it was still a pleasure flying with Emirates.',\n",

No one has bothered to contact me to offer compensation for the missing/lost bags. It has now been 4 days and I still am missing 1 bag which apparently they knew was missing on the 14th and sent it from Dubai. The call center has been less than helpful except for the lady that answered today. Basically it seems no one has any clue what is going on and this is really unacceptable.

       "  '71': \"  I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water. Juice/water/fruits ??\",\n",

No apology was given for the limited choices and the FA gave a take it or leave it tone with us. The snack was served shortly after and no one bothered to collect the trash from us after that. One FA told us to leave it behind. Unprofessional service!',\n",

After pressing 2 buttons I was talking to a rep after less than 2 minutes. Much to my surprise, for a base ticket, he said I was entitled to a refund and sent me a refund form. Nothing arrived for a month so I again phoned and the mistake I had made in completing the refund form was explained and another sent. After only 2 weeks a partial refund for 'no show' was credited to my account and when I queried why 'no show' for a cancellation I received an apologetic mail confirming full refund which duly arrived after only 10 days. This compares with Ryanair who will fight tooth and nail to avoid any, even legitimate, refund. Guess where my loyalties will lie in future - Emirates!\",\n",

No communication, no one to explain anything. Staff were not helpful at all and neither were the ground staff. Disappointing, won't use them again if I have a choice.

Onboard the return flight, the flight attendant refused to provide bottled water for so I could prepare infant formula despite having charged me 10% ticket price as infant fare. Finally, on arrival we found our stroller damaged and the baggage team is proposing to offer is 500 AED which is insufficient to replace the stroller. Absolutely awful experience.

       "  '81': '  Bahrain to Nairobi via Dubai. The Emirates policy of applying excess baggage charges for items purchased in duty free on the DXB to NBO sector is arbitary. I have flown Emirates on a number of occasions and have never seen a weight scale at a departure gate in DXB. Each economy passenger was directed \"as per airline policy\" to weigh all cabin bags, including those containing duty free items. The response from Emirates ground staff for extra items bought in duty free was either pay the excess or return the items for a refund from the outlet. I understand the weight limits for cabin baggage from a safety perspective. However, I have not seen any objections from an ground staff when a passenger has purchased a number of duty free items in departures. Returning on the NBO to DXB sector no similar policy applied, same for the DXB to BAH leg. Emirates need to treat all passengers as people.  Staff at the gate ignored my request to have the extra cabin bag, (bought in DXB duty free) loaded into the hold, one option used by some airlines. Overall, if you strip away the slick advertising of the brand summed up as \"we are the best, (in our view) what you are left with is an economy service that includes food, IFE and cabin crew. My conclusion is very much \"buyer beware\".',\n",

First, as a first class passenger I was unable to change my flights online (I had to go through the inconvenience of visiting the nearest Emirates office to do that.) Is this for real? And you expect me to return as a first class passenger Emirates? Second, the service was horrible! Can you believe it took them over 20 minutes to prepare breakfast for me? When I asked for the cause of the delay they claimed that it took time to heat the meal. However, when I ran back to the galley to take sugar for my hot chocolate I found 5 or 6 cabin crew having a meal and chatting together rather than looking after their first class passengers. I do not think I would ever pay again for a first class ticket for Emirates, nor do I recommend any one to fly First Class with Emirates. Very bad tasted has been left in my mouth.

       "  '83': '  Good bye Emirates. In January I booked flights with Emirates for my wife and me, Bangkok to Rome via Dubai, returning Munich to Bangkok via Dubai. Due to endless amendments by Emirates our trip turned out to be the worst ever. One month before departure I was informed that flight time from Bangkok to Dubai has been changed. Usually not a big deal, but I would appreciate to be asked instead of putting us on a different flight. On the flight Munich – Dubai one of the flight attendant refused to offer soft drinks except orange juice and water, referring that drinks like Fanta or Coke have to be purchased at the bar. (what bar? as we were flying economy). Waiting for flight Dubai to Bangkok at the boarding area, about 15 minutes before boarding we were informed that it was changed to a different gate and new ETD will be 13:45. Right afterwards their ground staff left without further comment. We found the new gate deserted, leaving passengers for more than 2 hours alone with questions regarding connecting fights, meals or drinks. After having breakfast on the Munich to Dubai flight at around 4am, I expected at least a snack and a drink to bridge the waiting time of 2½ hours. About 20 minutes before boarding the ground staff appeared and informed that the departure will be delayed by another 10 minutes. 10 minutes later we were informed that boarding will delayed by another 10 minutes. At this stage a considerable number of passengers lost their patience and protested loudly. Finally boarding stated at 14:05 instead of 11:45, arriving at Bangkok at 23:45 instead of 21:25. Leaving us for uninformed, hungry and thirsty stranded at Dubai airport for more than 2 hours is unacceptable and contradicting with Emirates claim to be the Best Airline in the World. Under European legislation we would be eligible to a significant refund, but unfortunately we needed to book our flights in Bangkok. With the recent reduction of economy luggage allowance from 30 to 20 kgs (unless you are willing to pay extra $ for a “saver” ticket) and the implementation of a reservation fee of 25USD per person, Emirates is getting closer to traditional low cost carriers, while asking for premium rates. As a result of their new policy and the unacceptable mistreatment during our recent trip, we will avoid flying Emirates in the future.',\n",

Very friendly, hard-working and charming team of international crew, a medium load, free wifi for 10 mb, or only USD1 for 500 mb, all made for a great journey. Catering standard was better than average, a great choice of drinks and wine etc. The bar at the back of the upper deck is a must do. A lot of passengers went to sleep, I was having fun with the crew counting down to the new year, a first for me on the air! If ever there was one minor imperfection, that would be the dining table of my seat, which was badly designed in a way, when opened and folded down, it cuts almost into my stomach (I am stocky). Dining was not exactly comfortable with this fatal design fault. I took one mark off because of that. Otherwise, it's a perfect 10 from me.\",\n",
       "  '86': \"  Gatwick to Maldives via Dubai. Emirates was highly recommended to us but all I can say is it was a big disappointment and we are dreading our return flight with them. Positives - polite staff, seats comfortable. Negatives - service and amenities. Husband not able to use IFE controls as it had jammed. We ordered two courses as suggested on the menu booklet for a light eater. Waited one and half hours after first course for cheese (we ordered with our starter as we did not want the main course) - told that it had all gone as they had served everyone else in the cabin, even those behind us. After showing our displeasure, they did make up for this by getting us some cheese and offering good wine from first class. Why not offer this in first place rather than telling us the cheese had gone? On a long flight that arrives at night (2am), we wanted to sleep - not an amenity bag in sight. I asked for one and was told they only supply on night flights. Well I'm sorry but when I board and arrive somewhere early in the morning then I expect an amenity bag. That is night time and that is when you require those bits and pieces that add a little (paid for) luxury to the start of a hard earned holiday. Having paid thousands for business I do not expect an airline to be so stingy - they should supply amenity bags regardless of time of flying. People do need to wash and clean teeth and freshen up during any long haul flight. This is appalling cost cutting meanness and sorry I thought my thousands in air fare bought me a small bag of comfort. I have flown business with other airlines and received much better service. I was so excited to fly with Emirates as I heard good reports, but they will not be my first choice again really not good value for money. Felt there was no balance between profit and service what they needed to do was so little but the impact would have been so positive. Very sad.\",\n",
       "  '87': \" London Gatwick to Islamabad via Dubai. My first time on Emirates. I had heard good things about this airline in the past so decided to give it a go. Baggage drop-off at Gatwick was fine. The gate at Gatwick was horrible, a small space to accommodate all economy class passenger of an A380. Most of us had to stand for a long time before boarding commenced as the seating at the gate were totally inadequate. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but the IFE did not work. The seat would not recline either. The stewardess tried to help but ended up apologizing for the broken IFE and seat. The meal service was good and the quality of food reasonable, however, the portion sizes were very small. The flight from Dubai to Islamabad was not good at all. Boarding at Dubai was chaotic, Most passengers were not allowed to take their hand luggage on board with them as according the staff at the gate the flight was full and there would not be enough space on the plane for hand luggage despite the fact that most people had just one item of hand luggage with them. The boarding process took a long time and the gate staff didn't seem too bothered. The seats on Boeing 777-300ER were extremely uncomfortable, the legroom was very tight and the seat width was also very cramped. Shortly after boarding completed, the cabin lights were switched off with on the screens and seat belt signs providing any light. The captain announced that we would be delayed due to heavy traffic along our flight path. No cabin crew were around to answer any queries and any calls for them were ignored. We eventually left Dubai over an hour late. The rest of the flight was unremarkable. The crew were not very friendly and didn't seem too bothered. The breakfast was ok but again the portion size was very small. After landing the I noticed that most of the cabin crew seemed absent with only one stewardess standing by the door. She did not bother to smile or say goodbye to anyone.\",\n",
       "  '88': '  Ahmedabad to Los Angeles return via Dubai. An additional amount was paid after few days for pre selection of seats. The seat selection was changed thereafter. A web checkin for my return journey from Los Angeles was done on 12th June. After initial food selection of Vegetarian Hindu meal while purchasing the tickets, on all 3 subsequent occasions, the seat preselection, change in seat and web check in, the meal selection of Vegetarian Hindu meal was repeatedly confirmed. After boarding the flight, the food offered to me was either Chicken/Lamb. On specifically asking for pre selected vegetarian meal, I was told by the staff that my name was not on the vegetarian list at all and was asked to wait till meal was serving was over. I was never approached again for food: vegetarian, fruits, bread or even cookies. The only food I was offered was a small Pizza & then a breakfast which was eggs/ham.',\n",
       "  '89': '  Shanghai to Gatwick via Dubai. I bought an Emirates student fare one-way ticket as they promoted in China, so the value for money is relatively good. I initially just wanted to use it as an opportunity to experience A380 (my first impression of Emirates at that time) as well as avoiding more expensive one-way fare of British Airways, but it turned out that the flying experience was really more stable than  other planes I had experienced, and the touchdown on the runway was also the best experience in my lifetime. The seat was a little bit too narrow for me, so I gave only four stars. The meal was really delicious and fitted well to my taste.',\n",
       "  '90': \" The positives for Emirates is to do with the aircraft, as the A380 offers comfortable seats with adequate legroom. The list of negatives is quite big: - Crew members didn't bother to assist during embarkation resulting a really slow process. Even worse, when most passengers had to look for available cabinets to store their luggage nobody from the crew members even bothered to pretend to be interested and assist. Passengers who wanted their dinner to be accompanied with wine or beverage had to wait more than 20 minutes to be served. Long, literally long, queues at lavatories. Crew didn't assist at all. I do understand that when the not to be disturbed sticker has fallen from the seat, crew will try to wake you up in order to serve breakfast. Still that should not reach the stage where they will literally poke you and scream close to your ears. They could either open the folded tray and leave it there or let you a note that they didn't serve because you were sleeping. Having two options for dinner (when you promote yourself as top carrier) is quite limited. Saying that you have two options for dinner when the number of available portions of one is small compared to the overall number of passengers (particular flight was almost fully booked) is laughable. Some people do not eat chicken (sounds strange but I do not eat it), I can understand that due to any reasons you are out of beef (actually I do not understand it but anyway) but that does not mean that you have to force me to get your chicken dish and refuse (actually they did not refuse, just didn't bother to reply and moved on) to take it back. Cabin wifi is great as an idea. If only someone could say how to activate it on economy class.\",\n",

Seat was comfortable but you can tell this was one of the older A380 as part were looking a bit worse for wear. Food on this flight was among some of the best I have ever had. Lounge was busy but to be fair we sat close to the gate and didn’t venture in. Boarding was separate to economy however we still had to wait 10 min even though when we tried it was already 10 min past the boarding time. Got the two return legs to go, let’s see if the consistency improves.',\n",

Mediocre service on the ground though, a 20 min bus ride from the plane in DXB, long wait for baggage in CPH and no bag tag available at self service in DXB. Would still highly recommend EK.',\n",
       "  '94': \"  Due to winter storm in Chicago, they cancelled flight from Kochi to Dubai and Dubai to Chicago. The winter storm issue was with the second flight. But they cancelled first flight because they don't want us to stay in Dubai because it will cost them accommodations and food. They took  Americans because they have to and canceled our boarding pass after reaching gate and gave back our checked luggage. There were few passengers who had same problem because they told us to stay in our homes and didn't even have new flight to travel the following day. After endless number of calls, we got refund and booked Qatar airways with the same amount but as we booked the previous day,the ticket charge costed 1 lakh something more. But we paid because as it was urgent travelling for us. From that moment onwards we decided not to travel with Emirates. Will never forget the incident and crew was worst.\",\n",
       "  '95': \"  We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai. Due to bad weather in Europe our plane was late departing and we spent over two hours on the runway. Consequently we missed our connecting flight in Dubai. When we finally reached Dubai there was complete chaos. There were 200+ other people who also missed connections and it was not clear where to go. We followed the crowd to the desk area for help there were only 4 Emirates staff helping over 200 people get to their final destinations. We were trying to get to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania to meet a further connecting flight to start a 5 night safari. After after about a 45 minute wait we eventually got to speak to someone who said we could get an 8 hour flight to Johannesburg then a further flight to back to Dar Es Salaam. This would mean we would have got to Dar Es Salaam too late to catch our final connection and would have missed two days of our safari. Out of a 5 night safari this is a significant portion. When I complained I was told to stop wasting his time. Other people were also being badly treated. One other passenger found a replacement flight online and asked to be transferred but was told you've got your ticket don't speak to me anymore. Bearing in mind Emirates knew early on that the plane would be delayed they had over 8 hours to sort this out what they came up with was completely inadequate. It seemed everyone was being sent to Johannesburg. As the flight to Johannesburg was 4am the next morning we were sent to a hotel to wait. When we got to the hotel there were hundreds of other people waiting to check in as well. We queued in reception for over 3 hours to get our room but I'm not sure why we bothered as we had no luggage as this was still at the airport. Thankfully our tour operator Audley Travel managed to book us onto a flight to Zanzibar and then onto Dar Es Salaam in time to meet our final connection and only miss 1 day of our holiday and not 2. The flight to Zanzibar was with FlyDubai which is owned by the same people as Emirates. Why couldn't we have been offered this option by Emirates? You would hope this was the end of our bad experience with Emirates but no. When we went to come home we turned up at the airport in Dar Es Salaam over 3 hours before our flight was due to leave but were told by the check in staff that they could not print our boarding passes. The reason for this is because our tickets were out of sequence. It seems you have have to go wherever Emirates wish to send you in this case Johannesburg regardless of wether you wish to go there or not. We spent a further three hours at the airport in Dar Es Salaam not knowing if we would be able to go home. They said it was a security issue but they could clearly see our passports, they could see when we arrived in Tanzania as our visa was stamped with the date of arrival and they would have known our luggage had been transferred to a different flight. Only thanks to the persistence of the check in manager at Dar Es Salaam who spent over 2 hours on the phone and the immigration officials who sped us through security did we make the flight back home with only 2 minutes to spare. All in all I would definitely not recommend Emirates as an airline. It seems they can only run an airline if things run smoothly but are completely out of there depth if they hit a problem. The mark if a good company is how they deal with things when problems arise and in my view they completely failed\",\n",
       "  '96': '  Sydney to Dubai. It was my first time with Emirates and  the experience was negatively affected by the fact that 4 toilets of economy class where not functioning and closed. The economy class was full and people had to use the only 2 toilets functioning at the front of the cabin. Service was slow and affected by the fact that people needed to go through the attendants to go to the front toilets. At the end of the trip the toilets flooded.',\n",
       "  '97': '  I flew with Emirates from Brisbane to London return via Dubai. The staff were sour, acting like my asking for a glass of water were a hassle, and the food was disgusting. But the flight over was nothing compared to the return journey. After not being notified that my flight was delayed due to a plane crash at Dubai airport (ever heard of email, Emirates?), I arrived at the airport to start my journey home and finally found someone to guide me to a customer service desk, where I was told of the delay and given a hotel and bus voucher. The customer service agent also told me that the next leg of my flight would be organised when I was in the air - someone would meet me at the gate (I scoffed at that one). Trying to get on the bus was like surviving a round of the hunger games, after an hour I gave up and caught a cab. After spending 14 hours in the hotel I thought I would be winging my way home. After finally arriving in Dubai, there was no one there to meet me at the gate so I proceeded to the transfer desk, where I was told by someone who had just been served that the queue wait time was 7 hours. So after waiting for 3 hours I found staff who told me that if my online booking had been updated with my next flight, then I shouldn\\'t bother waiting in the queue as they weren\\'t giving out hotel or meal vouchers.  I checked online and found that I had indeed been put on a flight - scheduled to leave in 24 hours time. I settled in to spend 28 hours total in Dubai airport with the other people laying on pieces of cardboard and crates.  On my return to Australia, Emirates refused any compensation for breaching their contract by not providing any accommodation or meal vouchers and now \"considered the matter closed\", refusing to respond to any further emails. So if you\\'re looking to fly Emirates - beware! They may show you great service (which is a bit hit and miss anyway), but when things go wrong, they are unorganised and have no care for the people they serve or the inconvenience they cause.',\n",
       "  '98': '  My first experience of Emirates new premium economy class. Food and service excellent. Seats however are a little bit firm and not as comfortable as the pictures suggest. Also the recline is quite big so you can feel a little trapped once the person in front refines. Access to three toilets for 50 plus passengers is a real bonus and you get glimpses of the flight deck if that is an interest. I paid very little in cost difference which was the attraction but Emirates economy is very good in any case so May not always be a choice I am willing to pay much extra for. Also it was a two meal service for a seven hour flight which is good.',\n",

Wifi is slow, and in my opinion, not worth paying money for it.',\n",

       "  '101': \" I had a poor experience on this flight. I have been using Emirates' services for over 20 years, being a Blue member and, then, a Silver member, up until the time of covid. I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates’ service. Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered vegetarian food, and received a snack soon after take-off, along with a sealed cup of water. Subsequently, meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks, but I was offered nothing, and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink. At the next opportunity, when a steward passed by, I requested a drink, but was advised to wait until lunch was served (a very poor response, I felt). I reiterated: I would like a drink as soon as possible (as I was thirsty). The person in seat 30G was asleep and I could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance. A drink was subsequently provided (but over 15 minutes later). However, the table in 30F is/was not secure and the drink slid off, spilled over me and the person in 30G next to me. The people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess. Later on, lunch did arrive, but it was 2 hours after I had first requested a drink (so, my request for a drink had been vindicated). When food trays were later collected, mine was overlooked, the steward passed me by, and my food tray was left for over half an hour. When a steward passed by, I asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why I was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner. At this point, I was beginning to become very fed up. A supervisor later came round and asked if I was alright. I was fine (albeit tired), but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked. The supervisor was firm, but unapologetic, and asked me if I needed anything. I did not need anything, and she left me without further comment, her enquiry appearing pointless to me, as it solved nothing. Following this experience, I am unlikely to use Emirates again, which has left me thoroughly disillusioned with the company.\",\n",
       "  '102': \"  Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. KL to DXB has no issue at all. Was a smooth aircraft n service. The meals and services were good. But the problem has started with flight EK001 while flying to London. I already booked a preference seat and also requested a special hindhu vegetarian meal choice. But without my consent, there was a couple sit in my seat and asking me to exchange the seat. I didn't made any argument just accepted without any sorry and thanks from them. Later on when the special meals (veggie/kids meals) were distributing I have told a cabin crew that I made a special request for meals and exchange my seat. Please take note of it and give the meals to me to this new seat. After a second another crew came to me and begging at me said she wrongly delivered the food to the couple and accept her apologies. Still, I was keeping my calm. Later on, they offered me a bun which contains eggs. I've highlighted to the crew that Hindhu vegetarian meals doesn't contain beef and eggs. Why didn't check my request before distributing the foods. The crew came again and said  sorry.  Now same 2nd incident happened while from UK to Dubai on 31/12/19 on EK008. While the breakfast distributing I found my meals contain eggs. During lunch meals, a crew came and told me that she forgot my veggie meals request and I was offered a fruit platter. Sadly I cannot enjoy just a pineapple alone, I just avoided.  My next flight EK344 didn't offer welcome drinks and meals / snacks before landing. Emirates we pay the hefty price the service. But I didn't know you have cost-cutting strategy.\",\n",
       "  '103': '  Sydney to Athens via Dubai. Emirates is an overpriced airline with too much marketing budget and no substance, one that I would advise others to never fly on unless they have no other options. The flight was bad, but not funny or interesting experience bad - just depressing and frustrating and not worth the money you pay for it. My food wasn\\'t served until 6 hours into the flight (on my side of the aisle, the other side got served an hour or two earlier), attendants did not respond to the call button, and when they did serve you they did not speak, smile or even respond with a \"yes or no\" (when asked to bring water). Which was strange considering that had two shifts on board - so there was a lot of attendants wandering around, but none of them seemed to be working. The attendants ended up being more of a nuisance than service - because there were so many of them, they used the passenger\\'s overhead bins in my area (4-5 bins, about 5 rows both sides) for their items and passengers were left with no space. In an attempt to hire as many nationalities as possible, the crew had no cohesion or chemistry - they split off into sub groups based on nationality/language and spent most of the flight gossiping and chatting with their friends. There was audible laughter when the screen popped up with a \"what did you think of this flight\", followed by several \"terrible\" from the rows in front and behind us. The in-flight entertainment system was dated and old; movies not modern and recent, and the Business Class lounge experience during the transfer in Dubai was atrocious and left a lot to be desired (again, on the service side of things). These are minor issues but the flight was so terrible that these other issues are amplified and made worse. If you\\'re considering Emirates look at the reviews on this website, they have a 6/10 rating, which is lower than most other airlines.',\n",
       "  '104': 'Flew with Emirates for the first time. JFK to Bangkok with layover in Dubai. I chose this flight due to short layover. All would be great if the flight was not delayed. We left JFK later than projected and ended up missing our flight from Dubai to Bangkok, resulting is a 8 hour layover. Emirates were not exactly sympathetic or apologetic and only after much fuss provided us with a few dollar worth food voucher (incorrectly printed for 3 passengers only rather than 4, which they were not happy to fix either). The flight was ok. A380 is an impressive plane. Seat are relatively comfortable in economy section, entertainment selection was very good. Food and drink service was ok. The crew was very international and not super friendly. Our seats were close to the galley and the staff not only left the curtain constantly opened, letting bright light in, they were also extremely loud, chit chatting, laughing. When I asked a flight attendant if she could close the curtain in order to reduce noise and make it darker so we could sleep she just walked away, returning in a few minutes with ear plugs, which I never requested. Eventually we ended up moving to the back of the plane (as flight was only half full) and had a peaceful reminder of the trip. Return flight from Bangkok to Dubai was also delayed. At some point there was airport security on board going through all carry-ons.  However afterwards the flight took off and was uneventful, with same okay food/drink service and not overly friendly the international crew. Overall I was not very impressed with Emirates, their flight attendants could be more friendly and on ground crew could me more helpful. ',\n",

Prior to this, I\\'d request twice for assistance to find a suitable space, not the one above me, but my request was totally ignored. Upon landing for disembarkment, I approached the cabin crew supervisor and showed him the damages done on my purchases by one of his crew. He expressed his apologies and advised I write in to Emirates as there nothing other than apologies he can offer. He was also shown the almost-full state of the compartment directly above us where the packagings were crushed and damaged. I wrote to Emirates and below is their \"not my problem\" template reply from Customer Service Thank you for your correspondence of 03 October 2018 regarding Emirates flight EK 186 from Barcelona to Dubai on 29 September. I regret to learn that you found your biscuit box dented on the above flight. However, I am required to highlight that personal belongings brought onboard are the responsibility of each individual passenger, and the airline cannot accept responsibility for loss of, or damage to, personal items. According to our records, as you were sitting in the bulkhead row, you were advised that all bags and loose items have to be stowed for landing in the overhead lockers. It is my understanding that you did not inform the cabin crew that your bags contained fragile items. Notwithstanding the above, we certainly appreciate you bringing your experience to our attention, and I wish to assure you that your comments, along with the Cabin Supervisor\\'s report, have been shared with the departments concerned. This enables them to take appropriate internal action to improve the standard of service offered to our customers. I can also advise that the cabin crew operating in Economy class on this flight have received guidance in this regard. Please accept my apologies for not having met your expectations on this occasion. I hope that we can leave you with a more positive impression on your future flights with us. Emirates services from both cabin and ground (customer service) had changed over the years and this has been the worst I\\'d ever encountered. ',\n",

There are so many people to cater for staff can not handle it. No pre-dinner drink offered and had to ask twice for a drink. Staff were rude and unfriendly.

I was excited to fly on Emirates and try out their new amenities in the Business cabin including the bar and space to move around. However on the day of the journey I find out that instead of the A380 the aircraft was now a Boeing 777-300ER. A much smaller plane. Instead of the spacious and luxurious Business cabin they had changed our seats - it was now 2-3-2 with some of the business seats having no direct aisle access. I was in the window seat so was stuck trying to get to the aisle on both legs of my journey. The seats seemed a bit worn out, the IFE control a bit heavy and clunky and it was not a lie-flat seat, which on such a long journey is a huge problem. I hated the trip and felt completely let down. If they had not indicated that this was going to be a A380 I would never have flown with them and given them my money. Emirates then did an about face when I contacted them via email saying its well within their rights to change equipment and not inform passengers!

Not even a decent apology for pulling the old bait and switch and then feigning ignorance.',\n",

On the next leg from Dubai dinner was a turkey ham roll and that was it for 7 hours until an inedible breakfast was offered. Cheese and cracker with breakfast? Demonstrative of the lack of care and attention by emirates. Dirty planes. Smelly toilets.  I will never fly Emirates again. How reviewers are consistently rating Emirates above BA is beyond me and as we know BA is hardly a high benchmark. A massive TV screen and a large selection of films does not make up for a budget service.

Emirates refused to put me on the next flight despite explaining that it was not my fault. As a result I lost 500 Euros and had to go back to Copenhagen, and my hotel bookings were lost.

       "  '116': \" Arriving in to Delhi from Kuala Lumpur, I was in the transit zone to catch my flight the next morning with Emirates with a final destination to Lisbon. I had no checked luggage and warned Emirates prior leaving (early that morning) of my arrival in order to allow for a smooth transfer and me to check-in at the hotel in Delhi Terminal 3. I have previously done this with multiple airlines without any issues. AirAsia, a budget airline, ensured that I would be brought to the transit area and confirmed twice (additionally to my early confirmation) with Emirates staff in Delhi that I would be arriving. Upon getting to the transit zone (escorted by AirAsia staff), I was told that Emirates staff should be there and that they would assist me. It took 30 minutes for someone to show up. Needing a ticket to pass the security in the transit area, the Emirates staff had to go and print it outside; so I was told. I was expecting this to be already printed upon my arrival as everyone was warned. This not being that case, I was told that it could be arranged in 15 minutes. It took a total of 6hrs during which I was told constantly every hour that it will be another 15 minutes by Emirates staff. I couldn't sleep all night and obviously didn't get to the hotel in terminal 3. On top of this, no upgrade was available on the flight to allow me to get a bed when when I was promised by staff that I could do this at the gate counter. Some staff were completely incompetent by either constantly pointing at other individuals saying that they couldn't help me or giving wrong information. Overall, I can say that this has been by far the most unpleasant experience I have had with an airline which ruined the first 2 days of my 1 week holiday in Portugal. I simply cannot comprehend this lack of professionalism from a company like Emirates.\",\n",

Dinner ex Bangkok was rice with peas, carrots and mushroom.  Totally unimaginative meals. Surprised to get an amenity bag on the Dubai to Cape Town sector.  Hot towel also handed out on same sector which is something i haven't seen for a long time. Overall a good experience except Emirates must look at the special meal quality which is very poor. \",\n",
       "  '120': '  Dubai to Bangkok, The Emirates experience has been degrading for years.  Whereas flights of over 7 hours used to have two meals, they now have just one. Not even a snack can be spared on those flights (even all the European airlines they try to talk down do a sandwich or a snack half-way through the flight). Where the meals themselves would come with a lot of things on the side and used to be of good quality, you now get the same half-seasoned and half-baked meals they even offer on budget airlines. The advertised WiFi is non-existent on many flights (yes, the you can connect to OnAir but mostly there is no connection behind it). The quality of their crew has been degrading as well. After years and many flights on Emirates it’s time for me to move back to European airlines who seem to have stepped up their game under competition and who in general offer much better service and customer protection.

The local airport personnel was rude and unprofessional. Coming to Seychelles we had more then one piece of hand luggage, but leaving Seychelles they insisted on Emirates rules of single piece of hand luggage at 7.5 kilos max. The Emirates representative was absolutely helpless.  When I offered to pay extra for 2 kilos of hand luggage she just said there is no such option and she cannot help. Emirates do not respect their customers. The rules that are enforced are very inconsistent and depending on your departure airport, but in Seychelles I was told that they do follow the rules while at other places probably not.',\n",

Free floating Veuve Clicquot, very well mixed drinks and food choice. The full flat beds were extremely comfortable and the space was more than enough (I couldn't see my neighbor). Also I liked the idea of having your own minibar next to you. But I missed an amenity kit. This was a little bit of a negative point. Also there was a little bit of confusion during check-in. A lot of business passengers did not find their assigned waiting zone. The free Wifi is great albeit quite slow. Massive entertainment program like no other. All in all, a great experience.\",\n",

When we raised our concerns, the staff just gave us a shrug and said that we could speak to the person and asked if they would like to change exchange their seats so at least both my kids could be seated with me. Every other airlines would be more than happy to help us in rearranging the seating arrangements and will be the ones doing the asking.

The A380 is a beautiful plane, and the version that Emirates has outfitted is a little to flashy for my taste, fake wood and gold trim. The seats are great, lie flat with direct aisle access, the ICE inflight entertainment has a mind boggling array of movies and shows from every corner of the planet. Comfort of the bed was OK, a little more padding would be nice. They provide you with a mattress and blanket, which helps. Seat 14K has direct window access with storage against the wall which was great. Boarding directly from the lounge at Malpensa was really nice, I love the inflight bar in the back. The food was good, not great, I've had just as good food on domestic USA first class, although not as plentiful as I received on Emirates. A couple of glitches. The FA's completely forgot to serve me my main course, I had to ask after everyone was served. Very apologetic and kind apology from the FA. Next I wasn't served my dessert, I was dozing, that was OK. However I was offered a choice of desserts and the wrong one was brought to me. I expected a little more polish. The free limo service home is awesome. Also the agent at the lounge at Malpensa was really great, made sure we were checked in, confirmed the limo in New York.\",\n",
       "  '131': \"  Santiago to Sao Paulo. After my original flight from Latam being cancelled last minute (without an explanation from either branch in both countries until the next day after the flight would have left, I was forced to book a last minute (6 days in advance) cheapest flight I could find out of the country. I came across Emirates and booked a direct, roundtrip flight from Santiago to Sao Paulo for over $800. When arriving at my gate and waiting for my flight, my flight information was not up on the screen when it was supposed to be boarding. It said the UAE flight with whatever number (which, i guess in their defense was the same number as my EK flight) heading to Dubai was posted. confused, I looked at the screen of all the departing flights and mine was not mentioned. Remember, I was going to Sao Paulo, Brazil, not Dubai, UAE. I went up the workers at the Dubai counter asking them if they knew where my flight got cancelled since it would have been the same company. They said that was the same flight. The screen only said Dubai and had a different flight code. I never would have known that was my flight. We asked the workers several times to clarify that we were going to be getting off in Brazil since if they were wrong we would end up on the other side of the world. They confirmed again. I will compliment them on their politeness and calmness as I was definitely not very calm with them. Nowhere on the website, the check in online, my ticket, with the bag drop employee, or anywhere /one was it mentioned that the final destination was Dubai and Sao Paulo was just a stop over. Of course, when we were about the depart they were having brake issues for an hour, as well. Everything worked out in the end thankfully and they did serve a generous amount of food. But I would suggest posting (or at least notifying) passengers at least once of both / all destinations. I question now whether my flight was so expensive because of the additional destination that flight had and I feel slightly cheated. I don't recommend flying with them without speaking to them about all of the details of your flight.\",\n",
       "  '132': '  I strongly recommend flying with a different airline if you have an infant. Emirates are not what they used to be and their customer care is horrific. I booked a bassinet for my baby which means booking a middle seat. I booked 3 months in advance so I had the pick of any seat, yet I checked the requirements for a bassinet and was confident I would be allowed one. Obviously for my baby to have a bassinet was more important than me having a comfortable seat so the sacrifice was made and I chose a seat with a bassinet. Upon boarding I was told my baby was too big for a bassinet. I told them she meets the height and weight requirements but they insisted she was too big. They told me if a baby is capable of reaching the bottom of the bassinet they could push out the press studs and collapse the bassinet, implying that only babies who don’t move in their sleep are able to use a bassinet. This left me in complete distress knowing I had 15 hours ahead of me with my infant on my knee on a front row middle seat. I was in a fit of tears and the flight attendant said sorry there’s nothing I can do. Our flight was at 9pm so I had already been awake all day and had no sleep the whole flight. I couldn’t eat because the fold out tray from the chair arm wouldn’t fit in front of me and my baby and the one time she was asleep my meal had two hairs in it. I was so upset I just gave them my tray back (to which they huffed at me for having to take it when they weren’t ready) and didn’t eat for the journey. I then had a 3 hour wait in Dubai before another 7 hour flight. I asked if I could change this seat and they said no the flights was full which caused me to have a panic attack and almost faint after no food or sleep for a very long time. No one attended to me except one passenger and we had to get on the plane and sit in a middle seat for another 7 hours with no sleep. There was a nice attendant on the second flight who allowed me to stand up and eat a danish while my baby slept on my chair. Honestly if I could cancel my return flight and book with another airline I would. I will never ever fly with emirates again.',\n",

Individuals like themselves are a credit to Emirates. IFE has a wide selection of movies and the dining was of high quality. My only criticism would be if the Orlando route was not served with the updated Business class seat that is currently available on the other US routes; the current dated lie-flat seat is only adequate for short to medium haul routes but not long flights to the US.\",\n",
       "  '134': '  Check-in was easy at ICN but with a disappointing lounge situation, Emirates does not own a lounge at ICN. Inflight service was generally great although business class was quite full. Connection in Dubai was also not problematic; security for connecting passengers was fast-flowing and shopping and restaurants were open. Second flight was on a B777-300 but similar levels of comfort and service was  for business class. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), the in-flight service could experience delays as too many business class passengers are waiting to be served, the transit lounge at Dubai tend to be overcrowded and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. In my case, the in-flight Internet could be purchased at $19,99 for a 10-hour flight (excluding take-off and landing the Internet would only be provided for ~8 hours at most) and streaming would still be blocked.',\n",

On 3rd July, 2018 my wife and I took a return flight from Odessa (ODS) to Hanoi ((HAN) via Dubai (DXB); After checked-in, We have waited in long time over boarding time, and then a lady likes a Representative of EK appeared and made a contact with passengers in lounge to announce that flight was delayed more. And in long time waiting that lady appeared again to notice that the incoming flight from DXB landed in Kishinev (Moldova)- KIV and then flew back at ODS in a couple time. We and passengers on this flight have continued to wait. Nearly 02 hours later the lady informed that the incoming flight would flight back to ODS, but crews were over duty time then there would be no outgoing flight to DXB from ODS, it means flight today cancelled. The alternative flight ODS-DXB would be on next day morning, but she didn’t know when! How should I do when I was sure that We missed connecting flight from DXB to HAN? I showed our tickets, mentioned her that our connection flight to Hanoi and asked her what solution would be done for us. I received an answer from her: “I cannot do anything here because there is no computer, no system. I have only telephone!” Even She didn't care on my connection ticket. And she informed that Passenger were provided meals and hotel for that night and would take flight on next day but she didn’t know when! Emirates representative at ODS airport didn’t offer me any alternative protected trip except meals an hotel for that night! No answer, no choice offered by Emirates for me. It’s was terrible and truly that Emirates have set own passengers like me and my wife aside and had no care. Fortunately, there was an flight from ODS to HAN later at 09:30PM by Turkish airlines on the same day. I requested Emirates representative to make endorsement to TK, but She replied that she couldn’t do it. I requested her make a confirmation letter about EK flight cancellation to get refund later. She replied that I could get refund where I bought tickets and there people would know everything in airline system! Finally, I myself had to purchase 02 tickets on TK on the same day to fly back home. Until now nearly 4 months over I contact Emirate many times but no refund for cancelled flight was done!\",\n",

Flight attendants not present during almost whole flight. 6-8 hours flight only 2 times passengers got something to drink. Yesterday BKK-DXB onboard very rude flight staff. DXB-MAN attendants were lazy and not very nice. Talking a lot, flirting with themselves and definitely not interested about passengers. Complimentary limited WiFi never connecting. Food is poor, portions are small and tasteless. Return flight to my city someone took from carousel my backpack. Guy from Emirates airport staff whom I asked about help called that passenger who swapped backpacks. Then he told me to wait for that passenger, he will come soon and we can swap the backpacks again. He left me with not my backpack at public area and told me: keep eye on this. I lost two hours waiting and finally airport security guys came to me and asked many questions about what I am doing here. I told them what happened. They did not believe me and checked everything around me with detector and told me this situation is definitely against airport safety rules. Big shame for Emirates. I will not use anymore Emirates because at the moment customer service is unacceptable.',\n",

Paris CDG - Dubai leg operated by an A380 and Dubai - Cape Town leg by Boeing 777-300ER; both airplane types were new, clean, and excellent overall. This was a very nice experience, cabin crew was friendly, and we had stars in the ceiling at night. Food was delicious and came in more than fair portion sizes, I think it reminded me of Turkish Airlines which provides very tasty and large portions of food as well. I was even offered a 12-year old single malt Scotch upon asking (I flew economy class). There are lots of movies to watch in a fairly big display, seats are comfortable and spacious, and some amenities are provided in the long haul legs (eg. toothbrush/toothpaste, night mask, and socks perhaps, I do not remember). They gave away hot towels pretty often, in the return leg from Dubai to Paris CDG they gave a hot towel 3 or 4 tiles, which was very welcome.

Qantas blew Emirates out of the water. Worst business class ever. Really disappointed. You pay a lot to fly business class, so the expectation that something as simple as the food to be hot should be expected. Both flights the food was Luke warm. Can't stand cold food. It maybe the size of the A380 business class, but the whole set up seemed cold. Took off, and it was like a conveyor belt. Seat cushion on for sleep. Food orders taken. Place mat down. Crew were like robots, zero warmth. Qantas do the same, but just felt totally different. More customer interaction and dare I say warmth. 777 flight was a little better but the food was still cold. Sorry unacceptable in business class or even economy for that matter. Not looking forward to our flight from Europe back to Singapore in 6 weeks. When you save to fly business class, when the airline gets it wrong you feel ripped off. Yes they got us there in one piece with our luggage so I suppose I should be happy with that. We get to try Singapore Airlines and Turkish Air BC on this trip as well. So these flights on Emirates I dare say will be our last. Quite simply they don't live up to their reputation which is such a shame.\",\n",

Within 10 minutes of arriving at the airport I was seated in Emirates' excellent lounge enjoying an outstanding breakfast, as good as you will experience in the best 5 star hotels: cut fresh fruits, eggs benedict, stuffed field mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, warm bread and croissants. There were a selection of freshly squeezed juices and smoothies, but I opted for a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne. Boarding was on time and we were soon seated with a friendly welcome and another glass of champagne. The business seat on the 777 is a little narrower than on the A380, but still very comfortable and it reclines to a lie flat bed, with nice new design duvet. Service throughout the flight was perfect with very good crew visibility and a purser who really was outstanding and lead by example. We enjoyed drinks and nuts (Emirates makes a very good Mojito), then a 5 course lunch, with light bites or afternoon tea served before landing. The inflight entertainment is of course very good, although unfortunately there was no WIFI or live TV on this 777. We arrived on time and were soon disembarked. I had collected my luggage, done some duty free shopping and was in my limo within 40 minutes of touch down. Outstanding business class experience in all aspects.\",\n",

The A380-800 is a great plane to fly, plenty of seat and leg room and alo very quiet.

My ticket showed gate A3, but on checking the board, it showed B3 and this is where the main problem was. On arrival at the gate there was a long line waiting at the gate. I found out that First and Business class were to board by gate B2. There was nothing on the sign at the gate to state this. The handling agents seemed to be unsure of what there were doing. Then economy, business class and first class passengers were herded onto the same bus to be taken to the aircraft.

Not only that, the flight attendant didn’t apologise on both occasions which are of different time stamps, that’s a poor representative of the airline and i believe this is rather basic. Moreover and unfortunately, screen on the seat was blank and was requesting assistance to resolve it. Was reassured that it will be troubleshoot in 10-15 minutes. Guess what? Wasn’t resolve throughout the remaining of the flight. And also, i believe it’s basic to walk down the aisle once in awhile at your respective section to check-in with the guests to see everything is alright and needs immediate attention, but am noticing a pattern on both occasions, to and fro Dubai and Singapore. Seems like they only service during food and drinks, then hide back in the staff area. ',\n",

Wines were outstanding, 40 year old Port, excellent Cognac. Emirates First class food is a bit boring compared to Singapore Airlines and others where you can book your main course in advance. The second leg (EK 384 with A380) was a bad experience. Before take off in DXB I ordered my shower to have it 1.5hrs before landing. I was woken up very rudely by a female FA (she knocked loud on the door of my suite - on all flights before the FA's opened the door and woke up smoothly) and led me to the shower room. Normally in the meantime the FA's clean the suite and change the bed into a seat. When I came back after 20 minutes, nothing had happened, so I called the FA. Unwillingly she did their job and went away. Normally after having the shower the passenger were asked for their breakfast order. My FA was chatting with another pax and when some minutes later I called her and asked for breakfast she looked at her watch and told me, that in about 10 to 15 minutes we would start the descent and she could not serve me. I now asked for the purser and a little later I got my breakfast. The purser later came to me and apologized and told me, that he is not very happy that Emirates needs so much new staff and that today after too short a time FA's can serve in First Class. For me Emirates offers outstanding liquor and wines, the suites and showers are wonderful but it is a lucky draw, what kind of service you can expect in First class. They are growing too fast.\",\n",

After numerous calls with Driver, Call Center of Emirates nobody showed up to pick me up even after 13.45pm. After wasting and waiting for almost 50 minutes in hot sun, I finally took a Taxi and paid to reach business arrivals terminal and neither luggage concierge nor staff bothered to help me with my luggage from taxi nor to push the trolley. I met duty manager and explained whole story and all he said was it’s okay we apologize but now please board the flight as you are late. Such a horrible customer service I never expected from Emirates, especially when traveling in business class. On-Board Experience: It’s Ramadan (fasting month for Muslims) month and I was fasting. Cabin crew informed me if am fasting then food will be served when it’s time to break my fasting but I should order the food in advance so that I get served. When it was time of breaking my fasting I asked for the food that was ordered in advance and very surprisingly crew told sorry we can’t serve the food and you need to adjust with a small sandwich box as we are planning to land. When I questioned crew why did they promised me to order food in advance and how can they deny serving the food for a fasting person then crew simply said it’s our policy and we can’t help. When I became furious then they simply gave me a quick main course to eat but I felt their frustration while getting served. I wasn’t served the food which I had preordered despite crew having enough time (around one hour was left to land the flight). Most of the passengers sitting around me enjoyed full meal (all items of menu) but I had to go through this bad experience because I was fasting. Crew argued a lot with me to explain that full meal will be served only during initial serving time and not later even if someone is fasting. I finally gave up arguing with the crew as I felt really embarrassed to ask for food again and again.\\xa0',\n",

There is a wide range of movies, TV shows and music in different languages. Even the latest movies are available. Although my flight took more than 20 hours it wasn't possible for me to get through the whole offering of entertainment. Nevertheless I got the impression that the cabin crew could be more present from time to time. Waiting time for service was sometimes too long.\",\n",

The pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely. With just a 1 hour transit in Dubai I hopped onto the A380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall. The air hostess on this flight were not as friendly. A particular air hostess kept telling me off because I crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle, I mean we were so squished. I fell asleep and they didn’t serve me the first meal, or even offer a drink when I woke up, they just past me as if I didn’t exist. The second meal was an excellent portion size, the food could barely fit on the tray. I particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola, and cheese and biscuits - for the hot food it wasn’t impressive. I had better food on cheaper airlines. The air hostess were OK about re filling my water bottle.

I had the misfortune to fly with them from Dubai to Auckland. The ground staff were very rude and unhelpful in Dubai, it took an age to get our boarding passes checked and when I did eventually get to my allotted seat I found someone else sitting there with exactly the same boarding pass!! the airplane was pushing back for take off while I was still standing in the galley while the air crew were trying to find me a seat! what does that say about their Health and safety and security. Anyhow the killer was that after the 17 hour flight to Auckland we had to queue an extra 3 hours in the airport to record the fact that our bags had not arrived. In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained  (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation. Emirates service once again has fallen well short of what could be reasonably expected from a quality airline. I fly to Australia at least once a year - I'll be looking at alternative airlines from now on. Very poor service.\",\n",

We lost one piece of an airpod at an Emirates EK354 bound to Singapore at 3.30AM local time. once everyone get off the plane, we inform the cabin crew that we lost which means that we seek their assistance to help find it. One cabin crew told “oh it would be so hard to find” without helping us at all, just standing and staring. One flight manager help us instead to open the seat cover and finally we found it. Emirates is overrated for everything. Food taste was so bland, quality of the meat is very mediocre. Cabin crew issuper unfriendly.

I enquired via live chat if I could take a hand bag and a small piece of cabin luggage before I flew. I was told strictly one piece only per person. Most ladies had a hand baggage and a travel bag with them. Travelled with golf bags and only were allowed 30kg including suitcases. Most other airlines allow much more than this.

In terms of luggage policy, where most of the airlines are allowing two pieces of cabin luggage (cabin + personal), Emirates is allowing just one piece for its economy passengers.\",\n",
       "  '163': '  Sydney to Madrid via Dubai. Being a Qantas FF I occasionally travel on Emirates but with a Qantas code on it. Now same aircraft (A380) but the whole experience is totally different. Have been on Emirates a few times a year mostly when routing to a Europe port other than London. Sydney being the Qantas home base is these days very efficient to get through. Self check in (even though i can use the First counter) and through security and to the Qantas lounge in probably 15 minutes. The Emirates version is very different and rightly so as it is not home base. The economy line up was massive. Fortunately could use the premium line and was through swiftly. Time for Emirates to start using self check in. Used the superb Qantas First Lounge and then moved over to the Emirates lounge which was a very pleasant place. From there the whole experience was pretty dismal. Had a whole row to myself in the main cabin which was great. Same sights and sounds as for the Qantas A380 but its the customer service that lets Emirates down. They just simply have recruited too many young kids who just dont have the professionalism or charm of the slightly older crews on Qantas main line. Its really a training problem. Having crew that speak 30 languages on board is fine but does not help if their manner is to put it mildly rather brusque. Charm school is sorely missing. Mid flight snacks are poor to non existent. Food is a little underwhelming. Delayed start from Sydney due to bad weather and a tight connection meant a run through Dubai T3 to get to the Madrid flight. Same plane, different crew but same lack of charm and professionalism. And Emirates...one other thing. Please do not have your crews take away blankets, act as general cleaners and so on around 30 minutes before landing. It jut is not a great look. Overall the airline needs to employ proper training methods or better still get some older crew who can teach the young ones how to. The fact is that Emirates gets away with sloppy standards since they have a great network, hard product in the A380, great airport in Dubai. For me it is the easiest way to get to Madrid from Sydney so have to get used to a substandard level of service which many people have commented on. I would recommend Emirates only as it has the route network and schedules. Bit short on other alternatives at that price point.',\n",

They weight everything even a tiny kid backpack and charged very expensively for even 1 kilo overweight. Finally, I never use this unreliable airline.\",\n",

I noticed that you have a bit more space for your legs than with some airlines, which made the flight a lot more comfortable. I was amazed by their IFE - so many movies, games, etc. I didn't use the WiFi.  The flight attendants were really friendly and I enjoyed the fact that they have a crew on board that can speak so many languages. The food was also very good. One thing I thought was a bit annoying that you only have that big assortment of movies on the longest flights, so I could watch many more movies from Durban to Dubai than from Dubai to Brussels.

They also has absolutely no priority for kids not in boarding and not for caring a small kid has special need like diapers you can not just easily book them in next day flight at midnight. With all these problems they put on us, they also did not want to let us take our yoyo stroller on board, we had to fight them and without stroller at midnight in a closed airport when they book us on next day flight I do not know what we should do.

       "  '172': \"   I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my recent experience on Emirates Flight EK2185, scheduled for August 6th, 2023, from Dubai to Catania. The flight was canceled less than 24 hours in advance, which severely impacted my long-haul trip. This trip was booked through the Emirates website and was disrupted just hours before its departure due to the cited 'unforeseen circumstances,' namely a fire at Catania Airport, which had occurred three weeks prior. Being an aware passenger, I was cognizant of the previous flight cancellations to Catania and the airport's incapacity to handle extra-Schengen flights. Consequently, I had been diligently monitoring the situation, investing significant time and financial resources from a remote location in South Africa to stay updated and explore alternative travel options in case of an eventual cancellation. My distressing experience began when I found myself caught in a bureaucratic game of ping-pong between Emirates and Flydubai, the airline operating the flight. Both carriers appeared to evade responsibility and failed to offer me any practical alternative plans. The cancellation notification reached me while I was en route to the airport, necessitating an unscheduled stop in an area with phone reception to contact the Emirates call center, as per Flydubai's app recommendation. To my dismay, I spent over 30 minutes on the phone only to discover that Emirates was not presenting any viable options for reaching my final destination. Furthermore, their communication regarding alternative flights from Dubai to Italy was initially unclear—mentioning Rome or Milan—and later, limited to Naples, with no apparent connection to Catania. It was only after a protracted discussion that the call-center operator finally intervened, reconfiguring my entire reservation to a flight bound for Milan, just an hour before my scheduled check-in at Skukuza. This change, which was seemingly necessitated by Emirates' arcane policies, left me in Dubai without compensation for the additional time spent there. I was accommodated in a shared room with no meals, a circumstance that I managed to secure solely because my partner already had a reservation for a Dubai Connect service. Following the call-center operator's instructions, I had to personally book a new flight from Milan to Catania, incurring additional expenses. The overwhelming stress and uncertainty surrounding this ordeal marred a significant portion of my holiday experience. I requested that Emirates recognized the hardships I endured during this journey, including the extra costs incurred due to the days of delay and the missed medical appointment. However, they just said they could do nothing.\",\n",

Happy to comply with rules, but they can’t and shouldn’t be discriminatory. LAX and COK can’t have different rules for the same tickets and airlines.

When we arrived back I have raised a complaint with Emirates who won’t pay the 600 euros.

Inflight entertainment is the best in the business and quite clear as to why that is. I really don't have anything negative to say about this airline. Efficient in its timings as always.

       "  '177': \"  It would seem to me that Emirates have spent all their money on advertising and celeb associations while overlooking the upkeeping of their planes or training their staff. My return flight London to Melbourne was one of the worst flight related experiences I've been through and a huge disappointment. One half of the entertainment screen on the first leg of the journey (LHR to DXB) was unresponsive so I gave up on trying to watch anything. The provided headphones are awful, and you can't use you own because of the archaic two ports stereo jack they work with. The food was simply awful on 4 of the 5 flight legs on my journey. Apart from the crackers and cheese, I ate next to nothing. Airport staff are incredibly slow at doing anything. Just one example: boarding our connecting flight in Singapore, they chose to guide all the 800 or so passengers onto the plane by having a junior member of staff hold boards with the boarding zones up. If you haven't been in the Singapore airport before, you'll probably not know that a huge part of the seating area at the boarding gate is behind the counter, so if you were sitting there, you couldn't see the boards at all, while another member of staff was trying to shout what zones were being boarded when. This confused a lot of people, that simply couldn't hear or see what was being announced. The worst is yet to come, as our return flight MEL to DXB was delayed by two hours due to fog on an earlier flight, this made us miss our connecting flights in Dubai. You'd think that, with such a big airline as Emirates everything would be fine as they surely have other flights to go onto. You would be wrong though, we were rebooked onto a flight the next morning, so 45 people on the London flight alone were stuck in Dubai for a full day. Again, staff were slow taking more than an hour to process the 10 of us in the queue.\",\n",
       "  '178': \" This is not a premium airline anymore. The days of Emirates being a premium airline are long gone. By now their planes are old, seats and Inflight entertainment systems are broken. On the way up to Dubai 2 out of three seats has sound only in 1 ear. And one seat could not stay in position. The touch screen did not work. On the way back 1 seat and 1 sound system did not work out of three. They charge heavily for wifi and they charge significantly for a seat in front. At a rate where other airlines offer premium economy, Emirates just let you sit a couple of seats in front. European and US carriers by now have closed the gap and surpassed Emirates offering better wifi, premium economy and more innovative entertainment systems (Delta lets you watch from your own iPad). KLM flies this route with brand new 787's. But where an airline should make the real difference, Emirates fails even harder. Service. They get stuck in organizational bureaucracy. Emirates call centre gave you the wrong information? Your problem. That issue cost 200 euros? Your problem. The manager says no. Can I speak to that manager? No. Self-service check-in doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in another line of self-service machines. Still doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in the back of the line at the classic check-in counter (after spending 30 mins waiting for machines that don't work)? Can't check you in before you do a covid fast test. Go to a very badly signed fast test area. Everybody there is already checked in? Being around the self check-in Machines gives you a true to life Ryanair experience, but Ryanair actually does a better job. People with issues all over. And this is covid times, with a lot less traffic. I wonder what happens when it becomes busier.\",\n",

While I made it to the gate on time, I was upset because my seat had been given away and I was rebooked on the next flight. This is also not the first overbooking incident that I have heard of. This is unacceptable as the decision for that was taken out of my hands. Having arrived at the boarding gate on time and being told that my seat was given to someone else was upsetting. When I finally got on the plane at 1.05am, there were a lot of issues with seating allocation since some families and couples were separated as well. ',\n",
       "  '180': \"Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow via Dubai, and returning from London Gatwick through Dubai with Emirates, in economy. I am very impressed with the experience on each flight I took. There were no major delays to speak of, the food was actually very good (minus the strange fishy starters), drinks were plentiful and they had a great database of entertainment. The tail mounted cameras are a fantastic feature and the wifi worked well - but only on 2 of the flights. The crew couldn't do enough to help, they were friendly and helpful it was refreshing compared to some airlines I have been on. One downside I found on all flights was that it took over an hour for the FAs to get the drinks trollies and begin service. Each time they started serving from the front of the cabin, which for me was fine as I was at the front - while the people in the back looked on longingly. The check-in staff at Gatwick were really miserable. Other than that, everything was perfect. The first of four legs was on the Boeing 777-300ER with 10 abreast seating. Yes the aisles are a little narrow but as there was nobody next to me it wasn't a problem. I'm 5'11 and 70kg - sat in the aisle seat and wasn't hit very often. Maybe a larger person may feel more uncomfortable, especially if the middle seat were occupied. The other 3 legs on the A380 were better. The seats were roomy and spacious, and on the DXB - KUL route the plane was 10 days old. The flight was empty and there were only about 12 people in a cabin of 120(ish) seats so the crew and I spent half the flight talking as there was little for them to do. 68A was a great seat as it has nobody in front. Overall, very pleased with how well everything went! I look forward to flying with Emirates again very soon.\",\n",
       "  '181': '  Trivandrum to New York via Dubai. I have been a regular customer on Emirates Airlines for the last 5 years and chose this airline over many others because of the great service in the past. However, in my most recent travels, I have experienced poor management of flight connections in Dubai Airport. Due to this, I have missed several flights to New York, have been stranded in Dubai for days, have lost or missed my baggage, or have had to run at top speed to barely make it to my gate on time. There is technically only a tight 1 hour and 15-minute layover in Dubai but lately, the flight from TRV to Dubai has been arriving 30-45 minutes late due to an inability to get a gate. This of course suggests poor planning and organizing on your airline’s behalf. This delay leaves about 20 minutes for us to deboard the plane, figure out our new gate, clear security (twice), and arrive at our departing flight. It is almost impossible to do this especially for customers who are first time travelers, older, disabled, or impaired. As an asthmatic, the marathon run I had to make from Terminal C to Terminal A led to bad wheezing and could have resulted in a medical emergency if I had not carried my inhaler. Several times, we only barely made our Dubai to JFK flight because we paid for preferred seats in the front of the plane allowing us to leave quickly. Despite experiencing this incredibly stressful connection, Emirates staff provides no support to help us off the flight quickly. In fact, on our December 12th flight when we alerted the flight attended about our very tight connection (EK201 was already boarding when we landed), she dismissively told us “everyone has a connection flight not just you”. She also argued with my father and I for 5 minutes further delaying our exit from the plane. This is poor management and could be remedied by announcing the names of passengers with very tight connections. However, it seems Emirates no longer cares about their customers. Due to our marathon run, we did make our flight on December 12th, but my relief was short-lived. We were informed that all 3 of our checked bags were not loaded and would instead arrive on EK203 on December 13th at 8:00 am. On December 13th, I called the Emirates number for baggage services at 9am and was told my bags had arrived and JFK and needed to clear customs before it was delivered to my home. I was also informed that I would be updated on my baggage status- which did not occur. My family and I were put through hell to get our baggage back. We had to contact Emirates 5-7 times within the day. At one point, a chat service agent gave us conflicting information insisting that our baggage was still in Dubai despite being told otherwise many times. Ultimately after and exhausting flight and while still jetlagged we had to stay up until 2:30 am calling both Emirates and the delivery company (Bex) every hour till our bags were delivered. Due to the issues detailed above, my family and I have decided to no longer fly Emirates. . I used to be a loyal customer, but your company has really gone down the drain these past few flights and loyalty is not a good enough reason to suffer during my travels. Horrible Service. Horrible Airline.',\n",

These were my options and I choose chicken curry.  Snack was a small pizza which was a joke. I was hungry for the whole duration of the flight.

Mumbai to Dubai was on an old 777 but was suitable for this length flight. The seat is comfortable and spacious, and the IFE screen of reasonable resolution and had a good selection. Food was fine. The lounge at Dubai is not a particularly good one in my opinion as it is huge and chaotic and not a particularly nice layout. I appreciate this is only business not first, but still would have preferred less of a corridor feel to it, as well as self service drinks areas dotted about. Dubai to Gatwick leg was excellent. The superior level of the seat is significant and avod is excellent. The cabin crew on this flight were friendly and attentive. The only very minor niggle is that the food and wine service were not coordinated at all, so the wine was served after the meal rather than with it. This was after two glasses of champagne and a gin and tonic though so no real complaint. The big let down was Gatwick airport where we were not offered premium service for immigration. Gatwick is awful at the moment and the queue was enormous. This as well as the ridiculous and terribly organised baggage reclaim (which clearly is not able cope with the A380) let down the whole premium experience of Emirates down.',\n",

No water provided on boarding the aircraft and you had to ask for water and that also was cheaply been distributed in open plastic glasses the way they do it by the road side in India pouring out of packaged drinking water bottles. For more than an hour no water or snacks were offered and the food that was served was average and that was it, no munchies or a bottle of water before the dinner was served. Getting a glass of juice was a challenge and everything was being served very stingily. 5The flight seats are of very poor width since the flight is crammed with lot many seats per row, the food tray could barely fit on it. Uncomfortable aisles and poor comfort overall. The positive -  The inflight entertainment and camera view, that was the only saving grace.  Comparatively new flight and clean upholstery. Conclusion - For me Emirates was as average as any other full service airlines in India. Not too happy about the overrated hype regarding brand Emirates especially on Indian routes.',\n",

Total lack of customer care. I appreciate problems were caused by the storm in UAE, but this does not excuse Emirates of customer care. No information was supplied in Bangkok as to rescheduled flight and connections and therefore had 12 hour wait. Once on board flight the crew were indifferent and unhelpful. Arrived in Dubai and no help with connection flight. Went to business lounge and was told we had been downgraded to economy and we had 27 minutes to make the flight or would have to wait for 2 days for another flight. Was told luggage would be transferred on flight so we decided to run to catch the flight. Seated next to toilet and disturbed by smell and passengers all flight. Arrived at Birmingham to be told luggage was still in Dubai. Have yet to be contacted about compensation for downgrade or delayed baggage despite making complaint at BHX. I think Emirates is on the slippery slope of becoming arrogant and then awful.',\n",
       "  '190': \"  Munich to Auckland via Dubai. Plane and seating is comfortable. Service could really be improved. Other than a drink with the meal there were no further offers for cups of tea or even water for the rest of the flight. Meal service including clearing trays took extremely long, so not being able to get up to use the toilet for 2 hours isn't great. Staff in general do not seem to be interested. Is this just in economy? In comparison, flew long haul with Singapore Airlines, also economy, last year. Quite a difference. Flight Crew seem genuinely interested, very friendly and frequently came through to offer drinks throughout the flight. It doesn't take much to get excellent marks for cabin staff service.\",\n",
       "  '191': '  Dubai to Manchester. Boarded the plane at the last minute owing to delayed previous flight. The cabin crew walked past me three times without offering a drink although on each occasion she had a tray full of drinks. I did eventually get a drink but only after I specifically asked for one. A380 seats for me are uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Cabin crew service was poor and disjointed with the majority of business class crew spending more time in the bar area chatting, at times outnumbering the passengers there. The main meal was very good although the wine service was poor. Again, the chocolates mentioned in the menu were absent as was ant offer of coffee after the meal. In flight entertainment was good. This was the sixth flight on business class with Emirates within four months and each time I have been very disappointed with the product. Service on the A380 seems to be very poor.',\n",
       "  '192': \"  I have been flying with Emirates for business and leisure for over 10 years and have only flown Economy class where I have found the service to be of excellent standards. Recently I was offered the option to upgrade to business class and I decided to pay the additional premium. The service I received during my flight was disappointing, and quite substandard. Dubai to Manchester the journey began really well. After 15 minutes into the flight my TV and all electrical equipment failed to work which meant I couldn't not watch TV, close the blinds or switch off the overhead light. I made the cabin staff aware of this and was advised that she would reset the TV and this would resolve the issue. One hour had passed and none of the faults had been fixed. On my way to the toilets, I raised the concern once again and was advised that the reset would be done again and that it should resolve the issue. I sat patiently waiting throughout the meal service without any form of entertainment. I then decided to lay back my seat and get some rest and was constantly annoyed by the overhead light which I could not turn off. 2 hours had passed and a second cabin staff came by asking me to leave my seat so she could reset the electrical switches which were located under my seat. This was done twice without any positive result. The service I received in business class became anything but relaxing. Almost 3.5 hours into the flight and half way through my journey I was offered the chance to move to another seat which I found unacceptable and a little too late in the day. I emailed the customer affairs department and they offered me 25,000 air miles which amount to nothing. I cannot even get an upgrade! Really disappointed with Emirates and the way they have dealt with this. I do not recommend flying Emirates Business class, really not worth the extra money you pay. If you have an issue on the flight don't count on dealing with their complaints team after as they wont offer you anything, try and get what you want while your on the flight.\",\n",
       "  '193': '  New York JFK to Milan. As 400 passengers deplaned in Milan there were only two customs agents available for non European Union passengers. Poor planning to say the least. It took well over an hour to clear customs. By the time I tried to obtain my luggage it was missing. There was no one to check and see if the baggage removed belonged to the owner. What is the use of giving a baggage claim if it is ignored. Thus It is very easy to steal luggage from the airport in Milan. I had to rent a car for an additional day drive 100K to and from Verona, find a physician and obtain needed medications and clothes.One day of my vacation wasted. After 3 days I was informed that my baggage was found in Rome and that it would be sent to Venice where I was now staying. Emirates would not deliver it to my hotel and I had to go to the trouble and expense of traveling to the Venice airport to pick up my luggage. The second day of my vacation wasted. After obtaining my bag I was informed by Emirates that it would take at least 4 weeks to respond to my complaint. I’m sure that they just wanted me to have finished my travels to respond so that they would not have to upgrade my return travel. After 6 weeks I received a form letter that hid behind the Montreal protocol to tell me that they would pay for the clothes that I had purchased. No addressing of any issues or answer to any of my questions. My expenses and inconvenience went far beyond obtaining new clothes and Emirates which touts itself as “the greatest” fell short in its response. I cannot recommend any airline which will not enter into a dialog with an unhappy customer, address its shortcomings and fairly compensate a customer for its failures.',\n",
       "  '194': \"  Toronto to Trivandrum via Dubai with Emirates - during check-in the Emirates representative was rude and tried to mislead me by saying that I cannot carry my Laptop bag (1 laptop) and my carry on (7kg). I was told I needed to check in my carry on along with my 2 checked bags. My 2 check-in bags were only 10kg each. He scared me saying, I will be charged $150 fee for my carry on bag since I have a laptop bag also. He reiterated only 1 piece of baggage can be carried on board on a A380. Very poor form and service. I didn't expect this from Emirates. I declined his offer and proceeded with my carry on and laptop bag. Nobody stopped me at the gate. Hundreds of other passengers had bigger and heavier bags. Perhaps he took me for a first time traveler but I know the rules and facts. Awful customer service.\",\n",
       "  '195': '  \\r\\nDubai to Tunis. Flight was very very not comfortable, the seat was damaged and during my almost 7 hours flying and sitting not straight, my body was down to front. I have informed the cabin crew for the same and they informed me that no choice and there is one more seat is damage also! I don’t really understand that how come the flight getting approval for flying without doing any operations checklist.',\n",
       "  '196': 'Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The service was robotic at best. The seat was so narrow so much that the person next to me was basically sitting in my lap the entire trip, and legroom was barely enough. The food was very cluttered in choice and tasted bland. For a company that prides themselves on quality of food and service they should share that experience with the entire plane, not just business class.  The free WIFI was a bonus but at 10MB was hardly enough in the age of smartphones.',\n",
       "  '197': '  Starting with the best part: one of the reasons we selected Emirates is that they fly the A380 on all legs of our journey from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai. The whole upper deck of Emirates A380 is Business class. The seats are configured 1-2-1. You can make a 180 degrees bed from it, there\\'s a huge screen, a separate tablet (no idea why) and a mini bar with some drinks on it. Lots of space for everything. In the back there\\'s a bar with lots of delicious small things to eat and a good reason to leave your chair from time to time, even if you do not normally visit bars. The A380 is super silent. We flew Business Class on a Qatar 787 earlier and the noise level of the 787 is so much higher than that of the Airbus. The A380 is the best plane we have flown, unbelievable that they have struggled for orders. Emirates has more: free limousine service up to 65 km, in comfortable cars and all well arranged. Lounges in Dubai and Bangkok offer great food and other facilities like a shower, the Schiphol lounge in contrast has just a few things to eat. But Emirates has drawbacks too. Vegetarian meals in business class are very poor. One of our meals mainly consisted of two salads of the type \"what are the cheapest ingredients we can find\". Why not serve what they serve in their lounges? The best Business Class meals so far were from KLM. No A380\\'s but well thought about vegetarian meals. Also we phoned if they could combine vegetarian and gluten free. That could be arranged but it wasn\\'t. They can\\'t. On a business class ticket with a list price of multiple 1000\\'s euros. And it really is not so difficult. Qatar could do it. Qatar also serves the meal when you want - Emirates serves the meal shortly after you enjoyed the Dubai lounge buffet. Two more drawbacks: when we complained the reply was something like \"Sorry you didn\\'t like it but Emirates serves the best food in the airline industry\". So they can\\'t serve nice vegetarian meals and on top of that they don\\'t take complaints seriously. What I also disliked is that the entertainment system (which in itself is the best we have ever seen, title wise) displays news messages on all selection screens. Why would I want that? I am on holiday and don\\'t want to read news. But it can\\'t be switched off.',\n",
       "  '198': '  What a terrible first time flight with this airline in old 2x3x2 seating in business class on both flights and flight attendants on the first running around very unorganised and bad food which was inedible. The whole meal is served on a tray. On the Mumbai to Johannesburg after take off crew passed out mattress tops and turned of lights and there was no service as their menu mentioned. Breakfast was served very quickly before landing. This Airline needs to learn about service of Singapore airlines and we would not fly with them again.',\n",
       "  '199': \"From the moment I checked in, Emirates managed to make a mess of things. I asked the agent at the check in counter if I could use the lounge with my One World emerald status (Platinum with Qatar Airways), given that QF and EK code share the flight I was checking in for. She took my card then mistakenly entered the membership number with QF instead of QR. I didn't notice her error until I arrived at the QF lounge and was promptly denied entry. EK also switched my seat without informing me. When I asked about it at the gate, I was told that there was a note in the record that my seat had been changed in order to allow a family to sit together. That is fine, but EK could have at least had the courtesy to inform me at check in. Onboard, FAs did the minimum. I asked for a bandage for a small cut on my finger which the FA completely forgot about. The best was when I asked for ketchup to accompany my breakfast of hash browns and a frittata - exactly the sort of dishes one would eat with ketchup. I was informed that ketchup is only available in business and first class. What? Is ketchup the new Dom Perignon? Give me a break. Requests with the call button went ignored. Last time I flew with EK was in business class from NBO-KWI via DXB. I didn't find it to be a very good experience. The final kicker is they broke a wheel of my dependable and well constructed roll on bag. \",\n",
       "  '200': '  Dusseldorf to Shanghai return via Dubai. J All in all not an excellent experience with Emirates being the leg from Shanghai to Dubai the worst. Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit \"as award winning cabin crew\" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft. Food always better in the lounges than on board. Highlight for me the Emirates Lounge in Düsseldorf. For me the best food offer and comfort level I had in a lounge. Will recommend Emirates but image is better than reality.',\n",
       "  '201': '  Terrible service, very slow check in. Not trained stewards. I was told that for my toddler the seatbelt was not compulsory (I am not joking). Please choose another airline.',\n",
       "  '202': ' Flew Phnom Penh to Yangon. Excellent in all respects. In particular, the plane appeared very new/clean, and the IFE was outstanding - large size screen with excellent choice. You could even watch live Premier League games. All cabin crew were extremely friendly and obliging, clearly taking pride in their jobs. The only negative was the price, Emirates had significantly raised the price of the flight from a few weeks earlier, when I previously took the same flight.',\n",
       "  '203': '  Lusaka - Beijing return via Dubai with Emirates. All flights departed and arrived on time. Service and meals good. Ticket price was very good, under $700 return. No one can beat the Emirates in-flight entertainment. Connection time in Dubai was 4 hours out and 5 hours back, received meal vouchers for both legs of the journey when checking in. Increased checked baggage allowance, now 2 x 23 kg, was great. Check in online very easy with free seat selection. NB: if you require a visa for the country you are traveling too, you can still check in on line but will not be able to print your boarding pass as the check in counter must first verify your visa.',\n",
       "  '204': \" My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38 hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates. Starting Sunday 10th December in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived Tuesday morining at 5 am in Hyderabad/India. For those who don´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14 hours. It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in Frankfurt. Well things like this happen, but sitting for more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, Emirates weren't able to serve even a glass of water to passengers. The flight itself to Dubai was ok. In order to get the connecting flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running through the airport and finally reached the gate right on time. Everything went fine, we even managed to be at the gate more than 30 min before gate-closing - that was my thought. Here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us that our seats had been already given away without any further explanation. This is something I can't understand, I also know from another colleague sitting on the plane that the flight even had free seats (in business as well as in economy). The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 am in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, there was a long lane of passengers at the counter. We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a line, standing on our feet without seeing any Emirates-employees offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we managed to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to Dubai (another 30min of waiting at immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another Emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 am in the morning, we got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 am in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep. Summary: On a long distance journey things can take a turn for the worse due to delays and this is quite normal. But: I can't understand why they acted like this. There was no apology and the inconvenience was tremendously high. This was my first experience with Emirates and at the moment I am not looking forward for the flight back to Germany.\",\n",
       "  '205': '  Johannesburg to Newcastle via Dubai. This is the second return flight with Emirates to South Africa. Emirates may have competitive fares but this is not an award winning airline from my experience. The service on the last flights were poor especially the Johannesburg to Dubai leg, cabin staff nowhere to be seen, no water or juice offered inflight and the snack advertised a sandwich but this was also not offered and had to be asked for. The worst thing was that I had purchased the Flex fare which costs more than the saver but allows advance booking of seats. Emirates changed the aircraft a month before the flight but did not notify and the seat configuration was different meaning I was seated in a location I had not selected. Customer service was not interested and I received a poor response. I will be looking to use another airline in future.',\n",
       "  '206': \"Flew Durban to Seattle via Dubai on Emirates Boeing 777s. Durban to Dubai was very bumpy almost the entire 8 hours, so cabin service was limited to a single meal and a single drink prior to that meal. Cabin crew were fine, not overly friendly but definitely not hostile. The warm towels were a nice touch. Seat was a not terribly crowded aisle seat in row 41 made all the more comfortable by the fact that the person in front of me did not recline. Thank you! Inflight entertainment offerings were somewhat limited (just 400 channels) but far superior to SAA's offerings. Flight was very full in economy. Dubai to Seattle leg is a long ride: 13 hours over Iran, Russia and the north pole. Cabin service again was very good. The meal was ok; a promising chicken dish in a mustard sauce that lacked flavor when delivered but the rest of the meal was quite good. Cabin crew offered pizza a couple of hours before landing.  I was seated in a window seat on this leg which felt more crowded because I had people next to me and the guy seated in front of me reclined to the max as soon as he could and stayed that way the entire flight! IFE on this leg (ICE) was outstanding, over 1000 different selections including several Mozart channels plus a whole season of The Big Bang Theory! Plane was very full in economy. Overall, a pretty good experience for such a long ride. Booked 14 days in advance and still got what I consider to be a great price considering the distance and how full the plane was when I booked. If you're not a high-maintenance customer, Emirates value to its passengers is definitely superior to South African Airways.\",\n",
       "  '207': '  London to Chennai via Dubai. Extremely disappointed with customer service at Dubai international airport.  I was stopped near the gates by a rude manager at Dubai during my transit flight. I was told that I was over my allowed cabin luggage allowance of 7kg. My cabin baggage weighed 10 kg, I tried to explain that the excess weight in my cabin luggage was from duty free goods. He asked me pay excess luggage or leave goods there. I had to leave things at the gates before I was allowed to board. I wrote to customer service and although they apologised for the attitude and behaviour of their staff they were not clear about cabin luggage policy. In their own words “ I must point out that Emirates hand baggage allowance for Economy class passengers has always been one piece not exceeding 7kgs. Naturally, we allow reasonable quantities of duty free goods in addition to the above, however it would appear that the total weight off your hand luggage when reporting at the gate for your flight was exceeding your allowance”. I emailed them back asking for clarity about what reasonable quantity of duty free goods is but they had no explanation.  On board food was average with one meal served for this 7 Hour flight. I would certain think twice about flying emirates again and definitely not buying duty free from Dubai.',\n",
       "  '208': \"Experienced a very smooth journey with Emirates from Auckland to London via Brisbane and Dubai. Staff were friendly and on point with customer service, excellent value for money. Entertainment range was very good. Long layover arrangements were very good. I would recommend it to anyone looking at doing a long journey. However, the only thing I couldn't make the most of was the cabin Wi-Fi because it was too slow.\",\n",
       "  '209': '  Singapore to Venice via Dubai. As a regular of Qatar and Etihad on the Singapore-Europe route, this was my first time with Emirates. I would not call it a total disappointment, but the company is definitely (and sadly) not worth its fame. Positive aspects: new aircrafts, comfortable Economy seats with decent pitch, nice food (plus points for the metal cutlery), efficient ground staff. Seat selection is not complimentary and the cost disproportionate: the cheapest option for each of the 4 legs of my journey would have increased the ticket price by around 17%! Cabin service is close to no-frill airlines: no hot towel, no amenity kit, no staff walking around the aisle with trays of drinks during sleeping hours. The inflight entertainment on the A380 was a quite unresponsive touch screen with cursor. Charging plugs are only available to window and central seat. Worse part: the staff. I was told that an increasing number of Europeans had joined Emirates from Ryanair and I was displeased to see the same attitude brought to the 4-star airline. Apart from the lack of smiles and rough replies to some passengers that I could hear, the staff onboard the SIN-DXB night flight had been talking and laughing loudly in the galley for at least one hour after the light were switched off, going in and out without caring to seal the courtains. I have not seen such behaviour even on cheap low-cost carriers like Scoot or AirAsia, where the staff at least excercises the basic courtesy of letting their passengers sleep. With prices that are in line with its competitors in the region, I do not see the reason for me to fly Emirates again.',\n",
       "  '210': '  Bangkok to Hong Kong and very disappointing. I have been flying Qatar for many years and this is the first time to fly Emirates. The planes are badly designed with drab colors and no atmosphere. The food was bad and staff just okay. The whole experience was worse than Air Asia, but the price was very good - 20% less than Air Asia. So we will be using Emirates again but will take our own food.\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",
       "  '211': \" Sydney to Rome via Dubai. The services on the flight were beyond disappointing. I was recommended Emirates by friends and colleagues, as the best business class from Sydney to Europe. I was beyond disappointed when returning. Having flown to Europe business class for work and leisure with Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Etihad, and having flown business class to other locations on Hawaiian and Latam, I was very surprised to be so dissatisfied with the service and quality I received from Emirates, having been recommended by many colleagues and friends. I was disappointed to discover that the 14-hour flight from Dubai to Sydney did not have a lie flat bed (nor did Rome to Dubai, however, this was only 5 hours). More importantly, the service was appalling. My salad was rotting (attached photo) and my entrée was still frozen (attached photo). My TV repeatedly broke down during the flight (attached photo). The flight was largely full, so we could not be moved to another two seats seated close to one another. After raising this and the other issues with the crew, she became quite rude. Beyond our experience on the flight, upon boarding the flight at Dubai we were delayed as a result of the poor organisation at the airport for the duty-free items we had purchased in Rome. We had to provide these to be boxed and sealed, which was not the issue. The person who was doing this task, kept our boarding passes for the purposes of printing the tags to put on the boxes. However, we saw people who arrived after us, receive their boarding passes and board the flight before us, notwithstanding repeatedly asking for the gentleman to return our boarding passes to us so that we could board. Eventually, we were able to board, but only after first and business class had boarded and about half of the economy cabin. Finally, we did not receive any form of confirmation regarding our chauffeur from Sydney Airport to our home address, adding further to our stress as we were required to chase this to make sure it had been arranged. Having flown business class with various carriers, I was not impressed at all by the return flight to Sydney on Emirates in comparison. Business is not just about extra space, but about the extra service. The extra space was far from what is equivalently offered by other airlines, given the absence of a lie flatbed. Adding to that the poor service, I did not receive the benefits expected of business class, but instead economy. Since then, I have tried to liaise with Emirates to resolve the issue. After an offer of points which wouldn't even be enough for a single short-haul domestic flight, they informed me that they had made their 'final offer' and closed off correspondence. I would strongly recommend flying anything other than Emirates. Their service is terrible, before, during and after the flight and falls short of what is comparably offered.\",\n",
       "  '212': '  Dubai to Hamburg. Great flight The seat spacing was large and cabin furnishings modern and luxurious. The food was high quality.

       "  '213': \"  True color of organisation is discovered when time of need arise, and Emirates capability is discovered. Never fly Emirates again, do not recommend anyone to travel on Emirates - you will be left to dry. I checked onto EK421 with a 20 kg checked bag on 18th March from Perth Airport. Arrived at Dubai airport on the 19th morning, as of today after 3 days of being me hostage at Dubai airport - there's no information from Emirates airport staff on anything, no worry about my dietary needs, my medical needs, sorry about my personal & business plan). I am not allowed to access my essential needs & medication from checked-bag and they would not put me on to my next connecting flight. At Dubai Airport Emirates staff directed me and others to continuously watch out for the Gate number on the screen as the flight would be listed there (but they won't tell when), I and others kept waiting for hours for the flight to appear, they appear without gates, stay listed there and then gets canceled. Clearly Emirates are just listing ghost flights so they don't need to provide a hotel. I am now on airport for more than 36 hours, no hotel provided, no vegetarian food available, I now almost three days in the same pair of clothing, and my medication & other essentials are in a checked-in bag that Emirates staff don't even care and tell me anything on when it will be returned to me. Their pretext that this is due to rain is just made up, as of last few days Dubai has returned to normal, for sure essential airport services there shouldn't be hold up and the excuse of weather event is just hiding their lack of management ability.\",\n",
       "  '214': \" Check in pretty slick, but after that - oh dear. First flight left late meaning a missed connection. Other aspects of the flight fine - great choice of movies and food was pretty good too. Very little information and infrequent updates but it happens. However I guess it's then how you deal with it that counts. Connections counter horribly busy in Dubai, staff stressed and barely friendly. No flight available for 36 hours, and that is with an extra connection and using a budget airline we always avoid for the second leg (Jetstar). Four hours after landing in Dubai we got to check in at the airport hotel - and only smoking rooms were available. So we had a further miserable wait - including an attempt to chat to the disinterested Emirates customer service representative - before finally getting to our room. Which had 2 beds, 2 pillows, 1 towel and no baby cot as promised. I've had missed connections with the children on both BA and Singapore and while it's never fun, they've been reasonable (BA) or good (Singapore) at dealing with it. Emirates were a sorry shambles and have a lot to learn about dealing with problems. Most miserable flight experience on my first flight with them.\",\n",

Crew were attentive, friendly, food and drinks excellent, ICE was outstanding. In fact along with another S class Mercedes in London this is the only way to fly to London.

I tried to check in online but I couldn’t find the ticket and when I call them they said it’s canceled and you should call us. Then I asked him the flight is about 7 hours no time what to do? He told me to pay 1500DH if I want to come by that flight. I told him it’s your mistake, they said you are right but we can’t do anything for you. So I booked another ticket from another airline cost me 2000Dh. I went to Emirates HQ to complain but they said you should contact our office when you got cancel notification. I said I didn’t got anything. So I lost my return ticket and I lost 2000DH.

My recent flight with Emirates was great overall. But yes, their services went down (seat selection no longer free, 25kg only for Economy Class, no more hot towels served prior to departure in Economy Class. Other negatives are: WiFi was available but not working on both flights. IFE Box under the seats blocking some legroom. Very tiring boarding organization unlike Qatar Airways, Emirates closes the gate 45 minutes prior to departure time, while Qatar Airways closes the gate 20 minutes prior to departure time. Emirates’s 45 minutes causes a long long queue. Postives, good and comfortable seats, the 10-abreast B777-300ER is decent, not as bad as people say. Of course I won’t deny the Award-Winning Excellent ICE Entertainment System. Despite both flights were operated on old planes with very unresponsive touch screens, the movies selection were up-to-date. Very friendly cabin crew, excellent meal service for a 1 hour 30 minutes flight. Clean cabin, beautiful and luxury Orange-Colored-mood-lighting system.

       "  '219': \"  Dubai to Rome. I'm so disappointed. I have been flying with EK since 2002 and in the last 3 years i have seen a constant decline. It has now hit the bottom. Travelling to Rome has been a disaster from the start. At online check in, i could not find seats next to my 9 year old son. I couldn't book his seat without paying extra 50$ (my seat was free because of skywards) on top of the 900$ premium cost of the ticket itself (seriously this is what you claim in your radio ads favouring families). Called the call center. First time i was told there are no seats available (yet the app shows seats on rows 22, 23, 36 and 50). The second time I was told these seats are not eligible for children (seriously? bassinet seats not eligible?) and third time i was asked for 90$ to change my seats. Bottom line, no longer worth the premium paid. It used to be worth every cent extra, now even FlyDubai offers a better service (and you dont even pay for seats at check in!) Sad,  demise of EK myth.\",\n",
       "  '220': 'Colombo to Copenhagen via Dubai return. Emirates advertise that a business class ticket include a hotel in Dubai when you travel through this city and that you pick up the voucher in the airport prior to embarkation. We booked online and at the same time reserved the hotels and received confirmation on the hotels as well as of travel tickets during the booking process. In Copenhagen on the way to Colombo this worked as advertised and we were able to break up the journey into two 5-6 hr flights by staying overnight in Dubai. However, on our return flight no voucher was receivable in Colombo and we were told to pick it up in Dubai. In Dubai we were sent from counter to counter in the very large airport and were finally told that no hotel voucher would be issued. The argument used was that although you book online you have to call the Emirate office afterwards to confirm the booking! Apparently this is written somewhere in the small print of the \"conditions for sale\". In other words you may book online but you can\\'t rely on the confirmation received during booking but have to call the office anyway. So what is the point of having on-line bookings when the information is not valid anyway?',\n",

Asked for couple things it’s either not available like (tissues) or a mask? Food is terrible. Flight was late so now I will be missing my connection.',\n",

All flights were on time but the quality of service is not the same, they used to have a drink service before dinner or lunch which does not happen anymore. Now they bring the lunch and dinner followed by drinks. Washington to Dubai leg, service was much better than Dubai to Delhi leg. Still a pretty good airline and good service.

This was agreed, confirmed and confirmed again at check in where they advised it had not been added. On boarding the aircraft when those needing time/assistance were asked to board I found myself behind at least 10 able bodied passengers jumping the queue. To add insult to injury, after getting on board, the stewardess then made me wait while one of these able bodied passengers messed around for 5 minutes. When I did get to my seat, I had spent that long standing and queuing that I was in a lot of pain. Thanks Emirates. Arriving in Dubai where I was supposed to be assisted, again there was no help and I had to struggle across the airport in pain. Its now 4 flights requesting assistance and zero flights where it has been provided. Emirates may be ok if you are able bodied, but if you need assistance, don't bother.\",\n",

The service was also exceptional with the attendants appearing warm and friendly while the food was decent. The leg from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur was a whole different story. The plane felt old and gaudy. For 4 hours of a 6 hour journey, we were subjected to so much turbulence that it made it terribly difficult to do anything. Nobody could go to the bathroom too and so I spent 4 hours having to hold my bladder in. The passengers lose all sense of comfort and peace of mind when we have to experience a heavily bumpy journey for a protracted period of time. I was assigned seat 21H due to its accessibility to the bathroom. If anyone chooses this seat, I promise you that you would be subjected to people's butts brushing against your arm for the entire flight. I've had the flight attendants rush past me hitting my arm repeatedly without ever apologizing.  They would grab your food trays without asking too. The attendants on the A380 were much more polite and pleasant.  Their airline ranking must have gone to their heads. \",\n",

No longer the comfortable journeys I had enjoyed previously. Service extremely poor and chaotic. No air hostess seemed to care in spite of pointing out several times. Disappointed to find no pre-dinner drinks or appetizers, but only a good-looking menu with a list of fancy items - not so delicious to eat, unfortunately. They missed serving me dinner while most of my fellow passengers were enjoying theirs. Had to call an exhausted air hostess twice, but all in vain. Got my dinner after 30 min when all my co-passengers finished eating. Drinks were very sparse, not offered more than once, coffees were cold and tasteless, and most foods were poor and stale - mostly carbohydrate-heavy with almost no green salads. Not the best airline for service I have flown with for some time across the oceans. On my return flights an online offer popped up during the online check-in to upgrade to business class, but I got to upgrade for the first leg of the journey only - not the entire route as the offer disappeared on my second try (it gave me only one chance to upgrade). Not impressed with the business class kit-bag or other amenities. Couldn't sleep in the modernized recliner at all. Free business class lounge uses at Dubai airport were not offered in spite of buying an upgrade. I am sorry for Emirates that used to be one of the rare 5 star airlines. From Dubai to Athens to Newark, the rest of the journey was more like you would expect from a budget airline. Really disappointed, won't recommend to any friend or family, and will try to avoid in the future, unless a genuine offer is made.\",\n",

Probably only there to mollify you. Multiple experiences over the years with Emirates ground staff and systems point to a organisation culture of arrogance. Lost luggage - no response; Broken baggage - no response; Upgrade point refund - no response; broken seats - no response; broken TV screens - no response; Slipping accident in their Milan lounge - no response; delayed flight and no onward booking organised - no response; Frequent flyer points unlisted - no response; Corporate entity details request - no response & the list goes on.

       "  '229': '  Los Angeles to Delhi via Dubai. We have flown Emirates several times to visit family in India. However, in December 2016, an issue arose with our plane during take off. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. They kept us on the plane at the gate for 3 hours. They fed us dinner and right after we were told to exit the plane. We knew we wouldn\\'t be taking off that night, so having us sit in the gate area would\\'ve allowed for more comfort and food options. After those 3 hours, we stood in a line for 3 hours to get a hotel voucher since the next flight we could be on was not until Friday morning (it was 1am Wed Night at this point) and did not live close to the airport. We obtained the hotel voucher and headed to our hotel, only to be returned because the hotel was full and said the airline didn\\'t call them to approve the availability. Needless to say, we didn\\'t get to a hotel until 5am. We were put in a hotel 12 miles away and were told we could get refunded for the Uber, but it\\'s been 2 months since the receipt was submitted and still have not received the $58 back. Flight Friday was delayed again by about 5 hours, so we missed our connection and had to stay in Dubai a night since there were no open flights. So we missed 4 days of our trip. The cabin is nice, clean and updated. The food is usually pretty good for airplane food! There is good pitch between seats and good seat width. On our trip back though, our seat cushions were pretty poor in quality and rather uncomfortable/hard to sit on. I would fly again, but seeing how they recently changed their \"saver\" rates to where you cannot choose your seat until check-in, we are looking for another airline. For such long flights, it would be nice to have peace of mind that your family will be sitting together.',\n",

I asked if any first class seats were available as I cannot bend my knee. I was told both business and first class were full. This was not the case, after arguing my case with a member of airport staff, I was given a business class seat and it's occupant was bumped up to first class! I cannot believe I was lied to and that given that Emirates had sold my ticket to someone else they did not just offer me the first class seat. Instead leaving me upset and distressed in the airport.

We pointed this out and the crew said they needed to reboot it - this was done on take off but failed and wiped out more screens! As it was the night flight we decided just to sleep but to our horror the bed didn't work. This was sorted out but we were left with no ICE system. Staff said they'd report it and contact customer service when back home. The response was simple, no refund and we were offered some air miles! Not good service.\",\n",

There was a large contingent Dutch-speaking flight attendants on board. Even the captain appeared to be Dutch and all announcements were made in Dutch, English and Arabic. Priority cards were given for immigration in Dubai which went quite fast especially considering the huge amount of flights arriving around midnight in Dubai. Luggage was quickly delivered and we were driven by an Emirates driver to our hotel. Whatever negatively influenced the experience was Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.

When loading with economy passengers my wife was continually bashed with their large walk-on luggage, she had to move to one side to avoid in being hit.

Somehow in the air from Bergen, we decided to cancel our own tickets and delay seeing our 4 children and give up a weekend in Dubai - seems unlikely. Argued the point but no interest in listening to us and the flight left without us. We were not told where to go, who to contact, how to get any help and we had to wait for hours for our luggage to be returned to us after it was taken off the plane. We spent two days stranded in Oslo airport with no help from Emirates at all. Our travel agent confirmed that it was in fact Emirates that cancelled our tickets - for being a “no show” which is 100% wrong and we can prove this. We spent money on hotel, footed and lost money in Dubai from prebooked accommodation. Emirates would not give us anything in compensation. Flight home was empty / half full. No offer of upgrade or anything at all from customer service (or lack of customer service!). After a terrible flight home, straight through to Melbourne we were now a day late due to the airline. We lost a days work and had to re-schedule deliveries at additional cost to our business. After several attempts to write, email and call emirates customer service on return to Melbourne, we have had zero response! The lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful. I was prepandemic a frequent international flyer and in 20 years I have never seen such a poor display. I will never fly this airline again. Emirates is an appalling company that cares nothing for the customer experience. They do not care for Australian passengers - it’s all about looking after their own profits. Fly at your own risk as they will cost you money and care less. Oh - actually they did offer us a special treat from business class, how could I forget they asked if we wanted a cappuccino from a machine. I don’t drink coffee.',\n",

After reaching Dubai, the security man was asking so many question and checked my handbag very vigorously. I asked the security guy why he was being so aggressive with my belongings and he explained to me my boarding password code was \"SSSS\", which means they have to check your body and bag very seriously.

Just before landing, I press the assistance button to retrieve my coat. Nobody answered. Upon landing, I immediately walked up to a stewardess asking for my coat and she said I had to wait until all the passengers leave so that they can bring it up from the back of the plane. I mean, this returning of the coats or whatever should be done naturally before the plane lands and need not to be instructed.

On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink. Cabin crew is always busy at the back and hard to get anything. They didn't offer socks, travel package. Just blanket and small pillow. I did fly with etihad, Quatar airways and Turkish airlines.

We were able to get adjacent seats in bulkhead, giving us a good bit of leg space and being at the edge in the centre section of a 3x4x3 layout, the flight to Dubai left us feeling less cramped. The plane was organized in a way that offered spaces to stand and stretch and the bathrooms on the flight to Dubai were tidy. We were served ample meals and liquor was provided on request. Snacks were laid out in the galley. The collection of films to view was huge -- in fact, selecting from this immense library was a challenge. Good head sets were provided. Flight attendants were friendly and I thought their uniforms were attractive. The wait at Dubai to connect to Calcutta was several hours but the airport is a shopper's paradise. I found the prices on liquor competitive and there were many international shops and eateries. The terminals were clean  with ample seating. The security check between flights was smooth. At JFK on boarding, a camera snapped our picture; the boarding passes themselves were not scanned. We had economy class tickets but on boarding at Dubai, we found a cabin crew member selling empty seats in business class. He had a mobile credit card reader. We paid for two tickets. The business class was in a 2x3x2 layout and was uncrowded.  The cabin felt old fashioned and the seats did not go to 180 degrees; it was angled, but comfortable nevertheless. Attendants were  very pleasant. Duty free shopping was available and I picked up a a few cosmetics. No landing cards were provided. Neither were any amenity kits, though a pair of socks and a eye shade in a plastic wrapper was in the magazine pocket. The TV screens were on the wall separating the biz class cabin from first class. All the flights were on schedule. Emirates does not belong to any of the big 3 alliances. The only US airline you can get points with is Jet Blue. My first time with Emirates left a positive impression. If they were members of one of the alliances, I would fly with them again.\",\n",
       "  '258': 'Munich to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. Slow and bad Business Class Service. The first drink on MUC-DXB and DXB-PER took ages. Don\\'t ask for a refill - you won\\'t get if because the cabin crew is not able and/or not willing to cope with extra requests. Particularly bad was the meal service on the DXB-PER leg. Food came without any drinks - not even water. When I used the call button a flight attendant showed up after a while and took my order. However, the order never arrived. She came back after - believe it or not - about 30 minutes and explained that thy have not been able to serve my order because \"they were busy with serving the food\". This is ridiculous given the fact that they have a large number of flight attendants in Business Class. Emirates might have a young fleet of aircraft, but their in-flight processes are a disaster and they have no service attitude. They are entirely inefficient. I can only recommend to use the Asian carriers or maybe Qatar Airways when you fly between Europe and Australia.',\n",
       "  '259': '  Good business class experience flying from Dubai to Cairo. Now Emirates operates only 777s and A380s the product is very consistent and particularly welcomed on these shorter flights. Warm and friendly crew, aircraft in good condition and a choice of Rose or Brut champagne plus juices before take off. A pleasant hot breakfast was served and the crew remained visible and active throughout the flight. Washrooms were kept spotless and well stocked with amenities including Bulgari cologne. The only negative was that we were delayed waiting for late passengers which meant we lost our slot and consequentially were 30 minutes late arriving at Cairo. I regularly fly all 3 Gulf airlines and Emirates offers a superior product in both economy and business class.',\n",
       "  '260': '  Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai. We were scheduled to fly out of Manchester airport on Wednesday 20th December at 20.35. On check in we noticed that the flight time had been changed to around 21.10. We were not notified of any changes and the Emirates staff who checked us in gave us no explanation as to why this had been moved. After being in the airport a couple of hours we then noticed our flight had been further delayed. We were meant to arrive into Dubai international at 07.45 for our flight to Bangkok at 09.35, so the fact that the flight was delayed made us worry as we did not know whether we would make our connection flight. As a result we contacted our travel agent at Flight centre about our concern whilst in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. They called Emirates to raise the alarm that if there was a delay we would struggle to make a connection flight. We eventually boarded our flight and left Manchester almost two hours late and arrived in Dubai at 09.12. On the aircraft the captain told us that we were delayed due to the Emirates plane leaving Dubai late. We missed our flight, we had no apologies and the only option to get us to Bangkok in time for the 07.30 flight was to fly at 16.00 to Mumbai with Emirates and then a flight to Bangkok with Thai airways. This would land us at around 05.00 and in the meantime we would have a hotel room and lunch. We had to take this option but were not happy as this would mean we would lose our money on the hotel in Bangkok and our dinner reservation. However, the flight to Mumbai landed late, which caused us more anxiety then the flight to Bangkok took off late so we landed with under two hours till our next flight. I am extremely disappointed with the service I received with Emirates. The unexplained delays, unhelpful and rude staff in some cases, as well as missing our night in Bangkok was just not good enough. We were travelling for over 36 hours to Bangkok when we should have been there over 12 hours earlier. Whilst we appreciate that Emirates put us onto alternative flights to get to Bangkok we should have already been on the 11:45 flight as soon as our travel agent had contacted whilst we were still in Manchester. It was not the perfect start to our honeymoon, we spent time hanging around airports or on planes.',\n",

I'd definitely recommend Emirates!\",\n",

       "  '264': \"I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare.  The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome.  Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was there with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves.  Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes. I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again, different attendant but same story! I was forced to sit upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! Emirates boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead.\",\n",
       "  '265': \"  Hyderabad to Los Angeles via Dubai. Every time I have been carrying my cabin baggage along with laptop bag, including my travel this time. I flew to Hyderabad without any problem. However, while flying back from Hyderabad they asked me to make cabin baggage and laptop bag to 7kg which wasn't possible. So they wanted me to pay $50 for it saying additional baggage. Other passengers were charged similarly. If they had a policy like this they should have told passengers (Emirates baggage rules) so passengers are aware and better prepared, and not wait until check in time.\",\n",
       "  '266': \"  Hong Kong to Dubai. I was sitting in 42C (originally sitting on 42B but changed seats by someone else) on the aisle. The flight was really full that it was trying to get all travelers from Hong Kong and nearby cities to Dubai. The boarding gate was fair that I need to take the train to my boarding gate.  Cabin crew were nice and ready to help us. The meal selection included either Chicken or Beef, which I chose the Chicken with pasta which I think the taste is fair, not really good at all. I had ordered their cup noodles as well but it was neither taste well . The ICE flight entertainment is really good, however the hardware was not so adapted into it. The plane was quite old and they use the setup which years ago does. I could understand with that but I think it's time to get some renovation on that plane, which they could change to the setup on their Boeing 777-300ER. After some time of sleep, the snack came with Beef sandwich with drinks. Even though the sandwich was dry, it tastes better than the dinner. Before the flight landed, some travelers attempted to change seat even though the belt sign was on for a while, the cabin crew had to yell to stop them but those travelers changed anyway. The flight arrive Dubai almost an hour earlier than expected. Hope next time I will have better experience on this flight.\",\n",

After reminding the steward that I wanted eyeshades twice, I never got them!  After landing in Islamabad, the next day I used Emirates online complaint system and wrote them a detailed picture of what happened. I get an email from Emirates in which I was addressed by a wrong name, indicating that the whole complaint reply process just involved cut and paste functions. Reply was \"we do appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention. Please accept my apologies for not having met your expectations; I do hope that we can leave you and your family with a more positive impression on your future flights with us.\" They even got my name wrong.',\n",
       "  '268': ' Delhi to Amsterdam via Dubai. You know what to expect when you are flying with Emirates. The 777s are inconsistent in their economy class seats - some have USB ports and other have older seats. The food (AVML) is always superior and especially flying out of Dubai - actually the best plane food is served on Emirates. Seat comfort on 777 is sub-par in comparison to the economy seating in A380 which is the most comfortable I have been on in terms of leg space, seat width, recline and fittings. The quietest cabin on the lower deck on the A380 is the one at the back and yes, it does give a premium economy experience being exclusive with fewer seat rows. WiFi on board is inexpensive but can be spotty depending on the routes. IFE, of course, remains, fabulous. Cabin crew are mostly friendly - some are heartwarming and very helpful, while others forget their smile at home. All aircraft were very clean, have great in flight lightning including StarLight on the cabin ceiling (which I love) and well stocked, clean washrooms. The business class lounge in Dubai is sometimes very busy and the Concourse B one has the coveted Moet and Chandon bar which is a must visit if you have status. Showers are great and so is the food and service the lounge. Definitely recommend this airline.',\n",
       "  '269': ' The airline was very good. The boarding experience was good. The flight was on time. There was a blanket, a pillow and a headrest on the seat. The seat was comfortable and cabin crew was  helpful and polite. The service was also very good, and the food tasted amazing. The in flight entertainment is the best  and you will never get bored. Overall I think this is a very good airline and definitely worth flying with. I will fly Emirates again.',\n",

We arrived at a quiet time in DXB and the staff in the lounge were proactive, refilling drinks. A380 on DXB-AMS leg empty in Business Class which made the bar experience less fun but still a great trip. ',\n",

Emirates handled this exceptionally well, regular updates both in the lounge and at the gate. The service on board was professional at all times and made the trip very comfortable. The free inflight wifi is a great benefit and allowed me to keep in contact with my business colleagues to advise of my impending late. Made what could have been a wasted day to be a pretty good day.',\n",
       "  '272': '  Buenos Aires to Dubai via Rio de Janeiro. Perfect flight in Emirates First Class. This was a long flight, with a 3 hour leg to Rio, a transit stop and then a 14 hour haul from Rio to Dubai. I was the only passenger in First on the initial sector, and there were 2 of us on the second. Service was exemplary - warm, attentive and professional. The suite on the 777 is just as spacious as on the A380 and immaculately clean and shiny. As ever I enjoyed the mini bar, treat basket, beautiful amenity kit, writing set, and wonderfully soft pyjamas and slippers. I was able to get a great sleep. Food and beverage quality and quantity, as ever on Emirates, was First Class. Dom Perignon champagne, vintage fine wines, 40 year old port, ultra premium cognac. Wifi worked well and was available throughout the flight for just $1, not the rip-off charges on some competitors (Etihad and Qatar for example) We arrived early, luggage delivery was super fast and I was soon in my Mercedes limo and being whisked home. An outstanding flight experience and actually good value for money, considering the reasonable price paid. Highly recommended.',\n",

Now I also had a recent international trip with Emirates in a flight where the ticket rate was 1,20,000 per head and the seating arrangement reminded me of cattle transportation that I have seen in India. Kindly consider that people travelling in Economy are also human beings and please understand that when we do 16-20 hours of journey, you can at least provide a proper push back seat which is comfortable.',\n",

During both legs of the flight there was a mad panic from the aircrew attempting to ready the cabin for landing as if this had been delayed until the last possible moment. The flight deck reminding them that we were at 10000 feet and they really ought to be sitting down. At the end of the flight there was an announcement that 'I hope the delay hasn't caused too much inconvenience' Really? Arriving home at 1am instead of 9pm with young children? Missing the last tube?

To be treated like the way I was came as a complete shocker since never ever been treated like this prior to this unworthy experience. I had arrived from my flight from Taipei (Flight EK367) and was connecting Nairobi via this flight. I had 4 hours and proceeded to shop at Duty free as mentioned above has been my trend. I had checked in one luggage of 23KG in Taipei.I shopped for Chocolates. Upon heading to the boarding gate, I was stopped by an Emirates staff  who demanded I weigh my luggage before boarding. I was irritated as I noticed other passengers boarding without being stopped to and they had more luggage. I assume this must be a routine check. My boarding luggage was 4KG excess. This was understandable considering the duty free items bought. I requested the lady to consider as I had only checked in one luggage and if need be, they check in my luggage. The lady suggested I speak to the gentleman. The gentleman would not hear of it! He was rude and started telling me if I want to complain, I can do that but I have to pay the excess! My luggage cannot be checked in! Since time was running out, I proceeded to pay for the excess luggage of 4KG. Upon waiting to issue my boarding pass, two gentlemen in front of me who were boarding had more luggage and the ladies (Different completely from the one who requested to check) told the gentlemen that they would check in their luggage without even checking how many luggage they originally had checked in! How unfair! When I started to complain, I was told time is running out and should proceed for the aircraft. The whole flight was a mess and I did not enjoy due to me being stressed out and worried about the funds I had paid whilst people in the aircraft had more luggage than me.Is this really fair?  I do not mind paying for excess but a fair check has to be done across everyone boarding.',\n",

They gave me a refund due to they inconvenience but took it back when I tried to fly back from Dubai to SFO for some odd reason. They said I was supposed to call and rebook the flight to go from Dubai to SfFO which I did and now they’re saying they can’t find that phone call  and they tell me just submit a complaint form.

       "  '277': '  Dubai to Stockholm. Excellent check in at DXB,  separated from Economy class passengers.  Business lounge in DXB has really poor offers for breakfast. Disappointed. Boarding not great. Business class passengers have to give priority to economy class. Strongly recommend Emirates to change policy. I felt the seat is narrow (2x3x2 seating in business class). No such experiences with CX, SQ, LH, BA or SK. Extensive film and CD selection, but the info and guidance (for choosing films) in the paper Magazine were irrelevant. Hence, ended up listening to Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Strongly recommend Emirates to present the films in a better way. For lunch there was a selection and obviously made I the wrong choice. Cannot blame Emirates but other passengers are recommended to make safer bets.',\n",
       "  '278': '  Dubai to Manchester. I find that when you fly Emirates you tend to get one of two types of experience in the Business Class cabin. You are either totally blown away by the friendliness and the level of service or you are totally underwhelmed and thinking that you should have spent your money elsewhere. This flight was the latter of the two. The crew could not be less interested in the passengers. They spent most of their time on the flight in the galley say down chatting amongst themselves. The flight was a night flight and they said it was a reduced service flight! I explained that I was hungry so they gave me two tepid seafood dishes - revolting. The A380 was a 2 class model and quite frankly had seen better days and looked in need of a clean. Emirates need to lift their game if they want to keep up with the likes of Qatar, Cathay, Asiana or even Qantas or Air NZ. This was a poor effort by them, they could not care less and it showed.',\n",

Then they put me on a Dubai-London flight. When asked why this is the case, they tell me that I will fly to London and then wait for another transfer to get on Washington DC flight. Already exhausted finding our bags then moving the bags with us to a different airport and then waiting 8 hours, I told them I just want to wait for the next direct flight to Washington. They tell me I need to talk to the guys in Dubai for they can't do anything. But then upon checking, I find that I have an hour or so to move to the transit gate. At this time, I have no idea when I will arrive in London or Washington. I am now sitting at the Dubai airport to find out that I will have to wait another 4 hours in London. And they are announcing the flight to London need to be boarded. Since my luggage is already tagged through these stops, I am waiting at the gate. But I have to say this is horrible. More so since no Emirates representative is offering an explanation why these arrangements were made. Those that ticketed me in Clark airport in the Philippines was not even an Emirates staff. \",\n",

I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less.  It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times. The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead. All in all, for an airline that I was so excited to fly with, it hasn't been a great experience and I will be looking at other airlines before flying Emirates again that's for sure.\",\n",

When I asked the customer support desk to arrange for us at least a lounge or upgrade (min expected from them ), he was so rude and said this is “the best” he will offer and turned his back.

The flight attendants were generous to give out snacks/drinks throughout which really helped. Having Wifi was revolutionary that ability of being able to connect to friends/family is  great! Having dual IFE screen on the IFE looked fancy but in the end it wasn't that interesting. The contents of ICE didn't live up to its hype to be honest.

After our Qantas flight was cancelled we ended up at the Emirates desk being checked in for EK413 to Sydney the check in assistant was very empathetic after our traumatic experience.

Unfortunately even though they were very good to accommodate us the same problems resurfaced. The plane was brilliant, newer than the one we flew on in 2014 with a brilliant seat and inflight entertainment. The main problem is with the service and staff. Business class was no more than two thirds full but we were told that our meal selection was unavailable. When I informed the attendant that I did not eat either of the alternatives she said she would see what she could do. Her solution was to give me an economy main course, and not having enough food to fulfil all requests is unacceptable. The staff seemed disorganised and some had a poor grasp of English. My wife and I asked two simple questions of the attendants, one did not know and the other did not understand and had to get a senior. I did not have a dedicated attendAnt for sake of continuity and was served by 4 different people. No hot drinks were served after the meal. If you are paying a business class fare you expect value for money. I know we were transferred at short notice but by taking us we were still entitled to expect certain standards.',\n",

The hot food was very good with a good choice of Asian dishes, and we especially loved the freshly made to order dumplings. The only let down was that they served Moet and not Veuve Cliquot which was what was previously on offer. On board the cabin layout of 3-2-3 was disappointing and the seat comfort was not good. However the aircraft was very clean and well maintained. The service to start off was a bit hit and miss, although did improve after the meal service. Champagne on board again was only Moet. The promised drinks after takeoff was not delivered until we reminded them and also the wines we had already ordered with our meals did not eventuate until reminded a couple of times. The food was good but nothing exciting, with no dine on demand or pre ordering available which I think would be an improvement. No amenity kits, only socks and eyeshades provided.',\n",

Instead of clearing the issue with Qantas themselves, I had to go and talk to Qantas and forward Qantas message to Emirates, because according to Emirates (expressed in pretty arrogant way) I booked the ticket with Qantas and thus it is up to me to clear it. For me as a customer it does not make sense, as I would expect the airline to clear the issues they have with their internal systems themselves and not make the customer to try and resolve it at the airport, a couple of hours before the departure. Once the issue was resolved, the seat I originally booked, was also changed (from aisle to the window). Of course it is a small thing, but in the circumstances, it was annoying, as I particularly booked a seat at the aisle feeling unwell before the trip.',\n",

On the negative side, my seat on the return flight my seat was broken. I think an airline is expected to check their seats function before long haul flights.

A380 full as ever, but enjoyed a couple of hours at the bar before grabbing some good rest. Arrival at DXB gate delayed due to a ground issue, but crew kept us informed. DXB can prove a little tiresome as its so big. An hour in the lounge allowed a chance to grab some breakfast and a shower before boarding for CPT. Good seat in row 7 of the small front Business Cabin in 773ER. Enjoyed excellent service from the crew all the way down to CPT; great food, great wine, very good seat and IFE. On time arrival in CPT and bags quickly delivered to belt. For the fare, EK is hard to beat in Business Class.',\n",
       "  '293': \"  Cape Town to Dubai. The timing of the meals on this 9-hour overnight flight was senseless. Firstly, it took them 3 hours to serve supper, by which time I'd lost interest and gone to sleep. Then, they woke me up 3.5 hours before landing for breakfast, which I also declined because of poor timing. So, there was only a two-hour window when the cabin didn't smell like a restaurant.\",\n",
       "  '294': \"  Child Escorted service. I am so angry at Emirates. Paid for escorted service on London to Perth via Dubai route, that gives priority baggage only to have the luggage go astray. If this is how Emirates are with under 18's travelling alone and supposedly looked after, it makes you think what service you get for your payment. Now our little one has had to go shopping while very tired to get the basics. Come on Emirates, get into gear.\",\n",

As a manager of a national football team travelling with a group of 29 and excess team luggage, it is important to check everyone through and verify the number of items and be able to cater to the oversize luggage such as physio tables and medical supplies. The ground staff on the Emirates counter at Auckland Airport when we were starting our journey were superb. They were very efficient, helpful and able to provide exit row seating for our three passengers who were 6 foot and over. They went above and beyond in their customer service, which made the start of our very long journey a pleasant one. The lady that we dealt with and it would be an absolute delight to be served by her again.\\r\\n',\n",

This was my third flight in 2 months where I got the same reply. First I thought it was just my bad luck being related to the seat I have chosen. But I always pay extra for my seat selection and this time I had chosen the front section of the plane. Oddly enough I noticed that all the passengers on my front and back were also very angry about being forced to eat chicken. I will be also posting my next flight info which is scheduled for this Friday. I hope Emirates Passenger Services will take the necessary actions and correct this problem.',\n",

There was a bassinet which was too high that you have to stand up to be able to see the baby. There is air conditioning which blow air directly to the baby and there was a huge tv directly on top of the bassinet which changes the view every minutes and in the night it annoy the baby. When bassinet were installed it is impossible to use table to tv. There is a trolley on airport but it is not suitable for younger than 6 month babies. There is no gate check for your own trolley. They do not accept it. I contacted and asked if i can checkin my carry on luggage which is so common for other airlines, they said i can but while getting boarding pass they did not accept it, so i had to go with 3 carry on luggage and baby seat in. Over all the going flight was not good. On the way back the first flight was delayed and i had less than 40 minutes to catch next flight and staff was helpful. Even though the flight had 50 minutes delay in take off. The return flight was better and we had better seats but tv and airconditionning issue still the same. Another annoying issue was staff does not know anything. Every question you ask they will reply the same, i will ask and let you know which never happened. The only flight which staff was helpful was from Dubai to Hamburg. The rest of the staff was not good.',\n",
       "  '298': 'Gatwick to Hong Kong via Dubai on Emirates. Check in and boarding at Gatwick smooth and departed on time. My pre booked seat was changed to accommodate a family but my reassigned seat was still an aisle which was my preference. The drink trolley took a long time to come around and was followed by the food trolley. Meal was braised beef which was OK, but only lukewarm. The entertinment was OK but headphone socket was dodgy so only had sound in one ear. Landed on time in Dubai but the queues for security were horrendous. Easy transfer to A terminal and the flight on a newer A380 took off about 30 minutes late. Again, trolley service was vey slow and cabin crew seemed to do a poor job. As this was a 3am departure only a sandwich and drink was served before the lights went out. Prior to landing in Hong Kong a hot breakfast was served which was OK. Scrambled egg, baked beans, spinach, veg hash brown. Immigration at HKG took forever then had to wait ages for bags to be delivered to the carousel. All in all, an okay experience but the crew need to sort out the trolley service a bit.',\n",

I had a window seat and there did feel like there was a lot of room - I think the A380 does it for me.

The staff on board were very good and helpful.',\n",
       "  '301': '  Delhi to London via Dubai. Seating was alright. At both ends and particularly on the return leg I took note of the lethargic stewardesses. They had no concern about the passenger comforts. Consequently, in spite of having probably 12 staff serving Dinner/Refreshment the service was very late. Meals were served almost 80-90 minutes after take-off. On the return journey flight took off from London at 20.30 and my turn (middle of the Aircraft) came at 22.00. Food was run of the mill and not enough to fill me at least. ',\n",
       "  '302': ' Service is below sub standard. I travelled with my 2 daughters of 2 and 7 years. I bought my seat at the time of booking and the system wouldn’t let me to do the same for my daughters. At the time of online check in, I found out that my daughters were seated 7 rows ahead of me on their own which shocked me. Furthermore, I raised my concerns to the officer at the check-in desk. Her seat allocation was more terrible than the system. She allocated me in the middle seat, 2 year at the aisle and 7 year aisle right across making her to sit with a stranger. I was frightened to hear that bad news and had to escalate the issue to the supervisor. Finally, after 20-25 minutes of waiting, supervisor made me (compulsion) to sit with my daughters 7 seats ahead of my paid chosen seat. At least, it was a big relief for me before boarding. Money paid for my chosen seat was gone into Emirates account and no refund was made until now. More paper work following to claim it and a waste of time, so let Emirates enjoy that undeserved money. Service offered by the airline was below standard when compared to the rest of Middle Eastern Carriers and other standard carriers. Families travelling with kids were of least to no concern by the crew. However, I have to admit that Emirates managed to arrive the destination on time. On the return leg, my luggage is not delivered yet or lost on the way. Another issue to deal with Emirates now. Service had gone from standard to pathetic. I need to think million one times to make another booking with Emirates. Families travelling with kids are not recommended to choose this airline. More dissatisfaction occurred when reporting the above mentioned incidents to the customer support. Hardly any apologies to little reassurance from them too. Overall my travel experience with Emirates was pathetic.',\n",

However having the ticket in hand, as a frequent flyer, I am told that there is no availability to upgrade with points; only a payable upgrade is offered. After contacting the airline, they confirm that only payable upgrades are available. With the current policy of Emirates there is no need to become a frequent flyer with Emirates as they offer nothing to a passenger who has enough points to upgrade.',\n",
       "  '304': ' I had heard a lot about Emirates and hence decided to fly with them. The cabin space looks okay, there are cabins with more space to walk around. On the Amsterdam to Dubai flight which was roughly 6.30-7 hrs - only 1 meal and a cold sandwich was served - in between there was no water served either. For such a long flight - it’s disappointing to not serve water at regular intervals - but it’s still the good part until now. Later at Dubai airport the staff were just bullies. Everyone was just asked to move from one place to other without much organisation and not respectfully but as cattleherd. There was a visually challenged man who was not shown any help or sympathy either. The connecting flight from Dubai to Bangalore just kept getting worse with people handing food parcels out by hand saying my colleague will bring the tray etc. Very very bad experience. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone especially if travelling economy class - they treat you as cattle. ',\n",
       "  '305': '  Chicago to Lahore via Dubai. I am really disappointed with my return flight with Emirates. After flight resumption due to Covid, I reconfirmed my booking 5 times, on different days and they cancelled my flight 3 hours before departure. Moreover, they lied about reason for cancellation. They canceled my flight and told me CAA at Lahore isn’t allowing to land flights which was false. All other airlines we’re flying on that route and I also confirmed from CAA. Because of this, I had to have extra travel arrangements and stay at the city of departure as I came from another state.',\n",
       "  '306': \" Never again on Emirates. The business class seats are narrower than those on EVA Air, Singapore and Qatar. They are also not real full-flat sleeper seats as they do not recline to 180 degrees. For a very large business class cabin seating 50+ it has two small, narrow, windowless lavatories. On this flight one of the lavatories flooded and remained so on the entire route. The wine selection was decent but the food was utterly inedible and honestly hideous to look at. All I could eat was the soup and it was heavily salted. I've had much better food in economy class of poorly rated airlines. Last and least, the entertainment system was difficult to operate. Was anything good? Yes, the staff was excellent and so was the car service. I take four or more international business class trips a year and have never encountered something worse than Emirates, both Newark to Athens and Athens to Newark.\",\n",
       "  '307': \"  Seattle to Thiruvananthapuram via Dubai.  I was travelling with my kids, which includes an infant. The staff on the flight from Seattle to Dubai were rude and non-cooperative. I requested for warm water to prepare some food for my kid and it was provided after 2 hrs even after me telling them in the first place that it is for the infant's meal. At the airport just before boarding they made a fuss about my one cabin baggage being 8 kg and wanted me to move the 1 kg to another bag even though the total weight of the baggage's were less than the allowed weight limit for 3 people.  I had requested special meals due to some dietary requirements. The tray was provided well before the meal was served to rest of the passengers. With a one year old how many hours can I handle the tray? On requesting the crew member to help me out by taking the tray the response was we cannot do it as we are serving other passengers. All of them responded in a very arrogant manner. The passenger who was sitting on the aisle seat was so accommodating that he agreed to switch seats with me seeing my plight. I had to go to the kitchen area to get warm water every single time with my little one. The screen in-front of my seat was not working. I just wanted it to be switched off. The crew member said it will be done in 5 minutes and that he will be back in 5 minutes. Apparently he came after 5 hrs. The airlines says that they take care of people who are travelling with kids which is not true. The other passengers (elder people) were so kind that they offered to hold the baby for a few minutes so that I can use the restroom. On our return flight, I had requested for gluten-free meal which was provided in the flight from TRV to Dubai but was denied on the flight from Dubai to Seattle stating that I had not made the choice, even though i had opted for it in all the flights to and fro. I do want to thank the crew on the flight from Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram who were helpful and accommodating. They helped me out without even requesting. They took care of the baby so that I could use the restroom and also made sure that the passengers travelling with kids had a comfortable pleasant flight.\",\n",

Boarding commenced on time and I was welcomed by a very friendly and helpful cabin crew. The crew was very attentive and provided excellent service throughout a full and very busy flight. My window seat was very comfortable with lots of legroom and also a small little mini bar with soft drinks, which were replenished throughout the flight. The food offered on board was excellent and Emirates' wine list is of very high quality. Both food and wine offerings were very generous. The inflight entertainment system is the best and has a fantastic selection of movies, shows and music. The A380 is a wonderful plane to fly in, very quiet, spacious and the bar of course is one of the highlights. Overall, I had a great flight. After a 3 hour break I was due to board the connecting flight to Melbourne. Fog in Dubai though caused a delay but we were kept well informed by ground staff and once boarding started it was smooth. The A380 cabin as well as the service in this very busy flight (full business class) was again fabulous. Maybe just something trivial, but I loved that one could adjust the window blinds individually by pressing the respective buttons. The free inflight wifi in business class is brilliant and I enjoyed keeping in touch with friends along the trip. I managed to sleep for most of the flight and after a light breakfast (there are various breakfast options available, I decided to choose the lightest version) we landing in Melbourne.\",\n",

While I recognize economy class may not offer the same amenities as higher classes, I found the level of service and food to be subpar. Additionally, at Dubai airport, I was required to use an e-boarding pass, only to be informed upon arrival that a paper boarding pass was necessary, causing inconvenience. Furthermore, the air hostesses I encountered displayed a lack of professionalism and at times, seemed uninformed. Regrettably, based on this experience, I am uncertain if I would choose to fly with Emirates again.',\n",

Imagine requesting for hot water for baby milk (1st time on to the flight) and was greeted with an unhappy face from the crew. This is not during the period where everyone were required to remain seated. We are family of 8. Our baby 24 mths old and 4 mths old were not making things easy. The staff was rude to us from the start.  We were not demanding passenger nor were we rude at any time. We had on many occasions called them by pressing the button but at all times nobody came to our seat to attend to us. This is far from what we called excellent service coming from an international airline.  They told us to put up the hand carry luggage ourselves when my 13 yr old daughter had difficulties on 1 occasion. On another occasion there were clean pair of socks on the floor and they told us to clean that up. I was appalled by the choice of words they used. They even make unhappy faces when we requested for drinks as kids were thirsty. I am not a big eater but even i find that the food provided was insufficient in portion. We should have been served a proper meal for the last meal but instead we were given a small piece of pizza. As we were all very hungry on that day and Halal food was difficult to find at JFK airport we had to travel very far to have our meal at Philadelphia, the only place we know there were authentic halal food. This is from my experience. I was never required to send a feedback on service by an airline but our experience on 24 Dec with Emirates has left us so disappointed that we have no choice but to write this review.',\n",

I have flown Emirates First before which was similarly uninspiring - this flight confirmed for me to never bother again. Of course it was spacious and comfortable, couldn’t have been more so. The departure time of 5pm meant it was an ideal time to really enjoy a meal. There were only 6 passengers in First - me, another man and a family of 4 (including 2 young girls). So the cabin staff were hardly busy. After take off I did not see any uniformed flight attendants again, just a women in the serving ‘uniform’ who took food and drinks orders and served meals. She was incredibly surly and often just plain rude. For example, I when I asked for a simple champagne cocktail from the menu she rudely told me that it would take at least 15 minutes to make. Knowing that it only consisted of 2 ingredients I wasn’t deterred as she might’ve thought I’d be. The meal courses were roughly put down and she went through the motions of begrudgingly serving me. It occurred to me that maybe she was in a bad mood because all he colleagues had gone off to rest leaving her to do all the work. It was a very unpleasant experience for me.

I was not offered an upgrade on one of the legs or access to a lounge in Sao Paulo. In addition, it was only explained to me after I had agreed to this route change that the flight from Sao Paulo to Panama will be with Copa Airlines - not Emirates. As we are travelling with surfboards, this will cost us money. I wrote a complaint to Emirates and received an email stating that on cases such as these, they are unable to offer lounge access or an upgrade.

The seats aren't fully flat nor do they have direct aisle access. As this was also an old plane the in flight entertainment was fairly poor. While the screen was enormous, the resolution was very low and the controls were frustratingly difficult. The cabin crew were fine without being outstandanding as was the food. The lounge at Dubai was very good as we were in a smaller one rather than the main central one. The food and drink offering was very good and I liked that some of the bar was self service. Dubai to Mumbai was on a newer 777 and the entertainment was much better. As this was a short flight through the night there is not too much to say, although the cabin crew were fairly good, they did insist on waking up passengers who had ordered food then clearly changed their mind and fallen asleep (it was 4am). Spending a long time trying to wake them up, not just a quick tap or hello. Arriving in Mumbai was fairly easy with prompt processing on the ground. The chauffeur pick up worked well although could have been better organised at the airport itself as you just had to look around the busy bundle of Emirates chauffeurs trying to find your name.

He would then touch everything around us, including the armrest. Each time he dug up his nose, he would grab the armrest that we shared in common. He also put his hand on my side and touched the screen, picked up something that fell and handed it to me. He was openly digging up his nose and touching everything while sniffing, indicating sickness. I was wearing a mask. He was not. I was entirely grossed out and very concerned for my health and safety. It was not a one time act, but a continuing behavior, every few minutes. I told attendants to observe his conduct too. The flight was over 12 hours long and I could not stomach this nasty behavior the long flight and risk my fragile health and safety sitting next to this man, imagine trying to eat next to him. I spoke to the flight attendants a minimum of three different times. Their eventual solution was to move me from my seat up front to the very back of the airplane, far from my colleagues. I was traveling with three companions, two sitting in front of me and one in first class. Our paid seats were the first seats behind economy preferred class. There were dozens of available seats in that section that were close to my companions and only a few feet away from the section I was sitting in that I paid for. Rather than make my health a priority and move me to a safer section, they attempted to move me to the very back of the plane. They said they couldn't say anything to the man. I didn't want to leave my companions. It was so frequent that I took evidence the entire flight to prove it. The only time he used a napkin was when they served food, and he used the one from his tray to clean his nose. That is the napkin he dropped on me, reaching over me to the stewardess. It was their jobs to help keep me safe. I was content in the seat I purchased near the front, on the aisle. I wasn't seeking to be upgraded. But if those were the only seats available, in close proximity to the seat I purchased, and still near my companions; rather than make me sit over 12 hours stressed out trying to avoid bodily fluids; put at a health & safety risk sitting next to a man openly wiping his bodily fluids on my seat, the armrest & me, they should have moved me to those seats, not the back of the plane. \",\n",

Everything about the flight was wonderful, the quality of the food and drinks, the comfort of the seats, the amenities, the in flight entertainment system and wifi accessibility. However it was the intuitive service from the fabulous Emirates staff which stood out, alongside the onboard shower. Thank you Emirates for a memorable flight',\n",

The cabin crew were hardworking and friendly, planes clean and modern, entertainment was top notch, food high quality and you aren't made to feel guilty for pressing the call button to ask for more drinks. The only negatives were the fact they ran out of the beef option on the Newcastle to Dubai leg and then the fact we departed Dubai almost an hour late, although this was due to passengers not showing up and needing their baggage offloaded. I would recommend Emirates.\",\n",

I had two tickets for this flight on 13 July. On 4 July, I was informed that Emirates had canceled the flight. I contacted Emirates customer services and asked about any alternative flight, and they answered that they could not do it. They proposed later flights on 16 July, but it was impossible for us because we had visas valid until 14 July. I told him about it. So, they suggested requesting a refund, I did it, but they refunded a small percentage of ticket costs. I had two two-way tickets that cost 800 USD each. They refunded 188 USD for one and 250 USD for another for one-way tickets. Then I knew that Emirates for such a canceled flight suggested Turkish airlines, but the customer service did not suggest this option for me.  I am very disappointed that Emirates canceled the flight and did not suggest how to fly from departure to the final destination. Besides, they refunded not the full amount of one-way ticket costs. I wrote feedback-complaint several times to Emirates, and they answered that the flights had been canceled according to the OAE government and could not help me. ',\n",

It means I pay for ticket date change around 1000 AED more, be better if I bought new in business class.',\n",
       "  '337': '  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. At the recommendation of the cruise company we booked with, who said they receive a very good deal with Emirates we had them book our flights. Prior to leaving we phoned Emirates to arrange seat allocations, after this was done we were informed that we were to be charged an extra $200AUD for this booking. After complaining to the cruise company they did pay this cost. This is the first time we have ever had to pay for booking seat allocations on any airline we have travelled on overseas. As my wife has a medical condition that prevents her from eating anything spicy we checked out the food options with Emirates and their representative was very understanding and recommended that the best option was a Western Vegan Meal, this was confirmed in a email from them. On the flight to Dubai/ Rome WHAT happens, my wife\\'s meal arrives and if not the sauces then whether the fish,chicken,beef or pork all come out with curry in it. Regardless of complaints no other option available, no spare standard meal either. However, on the Dubai to Rome section when the same meal problem arose the cabin crew supervisor asked us for our flight details and said she would arrange to cancel this \"vegan\" meal option and it would mean my wife would have the choice of the regular meals on our return flights home from Barcelona. Somewhere in cyberspace this arrangement still lingers, for on our flight from Barcelona history repeated itself. Once again, No spare meals available so as before my wife had a whatever I could give her off mine, likewise the same issue came up on the flight from Dubai to Melbourne. Just to add insult to injury, as we were seated near the galley we saw meal trays dropped on the floor and the noise coming from there was loud to say the least, also we feel the toilets could have been more regularly checked as the basins needed cleaning and toilet rolls replaced as well as refuse bins emptied. Seated next to me was a young man with a liking for gin and tonics, He was seen ordering \"doubles \" e.g. two bottles at a time and also helping himself to the bar which was parked behind our seats. Added to this he decided it was more comfortable to squat on the seat with his posterior almost on the headrest of the seat. Of course what happened next was predictable, a full drink spilled all over me, so with using our blankets to clean up this mess and dry me off we needed two clean blankets. Request for same met with the reply that no spare blankets available, which meant we spent the rest of the flight cold no thanks to the air-con. However, just before arrival a flight attendant was seen collecting unused blankets and passed us with a large bag three quarters full of unused blankets, two of which I am sure could have been found with a little effort so we didn\\'t go cold. Needless to say we will never fly Emirates again nor recommend them to anyone.',\n",
       "  '338': \"  Bucharest to Perth via Athens and Dubai. Booked online thinking they are a 'premium airline' that offers great all-round service and the flights they had would get us home a bit quicker than our usual airline so we took a chance. Booking went smoothly until we tried to select seats! Couldn't select first leg at all (understandable as with another airline and of course directed to that airline that didn't even recognise the booking!). Second leg booked seats together OK. But site wouldn't give access to third leg - Dubai to Perth. Kept trying and after day of trying got access. 5 seats left and none together! You have to be joking. Booking made as two people. So they get your money but then you can't even sit together. Absolute joke Emirates. Needless to say we won't ever use Emirates again. We will stick to our usual airline in future. Unfortunately I see many have the same issue with seat allocations. Should have done my research better.\",\n",
       "  '339': \"  Gatwick to Manila via Dubai. Was recommended by a colleague to fly Emirates business class. What I was surprised about was I experienced 2 very different business class products – I was totally shocked at the difference. London to Dubai was on an Airbus and Dubai to Manila a Boeing 777. The Airbus flight was aligned to business class travel expectations, seat was reasonably comfortable, large selection of IFE, food was of a good quality. My only quibbles were the seat belt length seemed quite short – it was tight on me and not something I experienced on other airlines; staff helped when asked but otherwise didn’t offer. The Boeing product is significantly inferior – uncomfortable seating and it was not lie flat, no storage at all, 2-3-2 configuration, no amenity kit etc, slow food service with a very limited selection. The Boeing flight is like flying premium economy – a good amount of leg room and a wider seat (seat belt size was much longer) but that’s as much as I can positively say about it. It was a really uncomfortable flight for me given it was close to 9 hours – I felt cheated for having paid for a business class seat. Regrettably, I had 2 more business class flights that week with Emirates which were not refundable otherwise I would have cancelled. Flew HKG to Dubai on an Boeing 777 - just as bad (if not worse) than the Manila flight. What storage existed was used by the cabin staff, myself and 2 other passengers had to store our cabin bags several rows behind us in a single overhead – we had to do this ourselves, no help or interest from cabin staff. Food was awful. Lounge in Dubai served excellent food and beverages and had some nice quiet seating areas. However, if you wanted some F&B getting it was a bit of a challenge - I witnessed only 2 serving stations for main courses and tea/coffee - despite being there for over an hour, never did manage to be able to get through the endless throng to get a cup of tea. I regularly travel long haul for business but I'm afraid Emirates does not get a recommendation from me.\",\n",

I usually pay extra for an aisle seat , when I selected the seats for this flight I was not charged . My only complaint is the Asian Veg meal I usually order , it is always chickpeas and rice and fruit as a dessert ( from South Africa) whereas the special meal from Dubai and other destinations is always different and a proper dessert is available. Flights on time, crew pleasant except for a surly , unfriendly almost rude crew member from Dubai to Bangkok. It was obvious she does not like her job otherwise not a bad flight.',\n",

My sister had to cancel her leg of trip due to a diagnosed blood disorder that was serious enough she could not travel far from her home, fly, sit for long periods etc. While she undergoes series of tests to figure out cause and how to help her, Emirates would not let her cancel her one way, outbound flight. The flight does not leave for 7 months. They feel she can rest up and be healed by the date of departure.  She does have a flexible economy ticket to make the cancellation. They claim medical reasons are not approved reasons for cancellation of most of ticket value. Trying to change the name so i can save the trip and take a friend instead? Nope! Out of the question says Emirates. ',\n",

       "  '346': '  Brussels to Chennai via Dubai. Major concerns regarding Emirates flight and ground staff support at Dubai. My mother was traveling Emirates from Brussels to Chennai with stopover in Dubai. Knowing her medical condition, I ensured she would have a wheelchair from departure to destination for each flight. Due to her medical condition, she’s unable to walk. This wheelchair was once again confirmed prior to her flight. And again after her flight experience. Each time an Emirates representative told me that her wheelchair is booked all along each stop. However on 23rd February 2018, upon arrival in Dubai, she wasn’t given a wheelchair, instead ground staff rudely told her she had to walk as they couldn’t accommodate her a wheelchair.  Did not expect this from Emirates. As a result my mother was helped by 3 other passengers who helped her reach her connecting flight.  At this point I’m besides myself and have no words to express my fury over Emirates and its customer service. On her return flight on March 6, we had made multiple calls and emails requesting the highest level of wheelchair (apparently Emirates has levels of wheelchairs). Yes once again, she was denied a wheelchair at Dubai airport. Instead, Ground staff made her walk. Emirates have no customer service skills nor respect for their customers.',\n",
       "  '347': ' On reading all the post COVID reviews of Emirates, I need to take a contrary stance to all the complaints and mumbles. It was my first Emirates experience in 3 years, and as far as I was concerned nothing had changed, apart from the boarding procedure in Dubai which was nothing short of shambolic - but that is the airport, not the airline. As a direct result of the ineptitude of the gate staff we pushed back 1 hour 20 mins late. No matter. The service was friendly and efficient - nothing was too much trouble - and the food and drink really good. One doesn’t often have memorable meals on board any aircraft (preparation of same must be trying in the extreme), but the lunch served was top notch. A bonus in business class on board an A380 is the on board bar area, once again, service was excellent. I had a thoroughly enjoyable experience and look forward to my next Emirates experience.',\n",

Only item were Emirates have ample room for improvement is on-board catering, where Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines are much better, but I do not fly to eat well, would always prefer a better seat and IFE above better food on ultra-long haul.',\n",

       "  '350': \"  We booked a trip from London to Muscat and then Muscat to Dubai for a week before returning to the UK. Emirates left us stranded in Muscat Airport. They had cancelled the flight and not even notified us of this cancellation. They had just put us on another flight 40 hours later without telling us. We turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist. There was no help desk at the airport, their App was down and we couldn't get through to customer service in Oman or the UAE. We tried calling customer service in the UK, and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later. Bearing in mind, we were having to use our UK mobiles abroad. We had another British couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing. I am over six months pregnant and this was meant to be a honeymoon for us because our original wedding and honeymoon were cancelled due to COVID. In the end we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there weren't any flights to the UAE for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when I was six months pregnant. We tried to complain in Dubai & we were told they couldn't do anything, we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the UK. I lodged a complaint & we have just received the below response, which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to FlyDubai. Firstly, they are part of the same group and secondly, we booked our tickets through Emirates & they took full payment for the whole itinerary. Therefore, we are their customer & we are nothing to do with FlyDubai. They offered us a measly 10,000 miles each, which costs them nothing & is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago. You need a min. 50-100K to upgrade. Emirates response: Thank for your correspondence and naturally, I regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport. I do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused, especially as I understand that you are pregnant. If I may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines. Although there is a partnership, Emirates and FlyDubai are two separate companies and Emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa. In this instance, the schedule change occurred to your flight from Muscat operated by FlyDubai; whilst I am not aware why their proposed flight EK2033 on 5 November was removed from their schedules in advance of travel, I would like to explain that unfortunately, there are rare occasions when these cannot be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. That being said, I note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of Emirates, as well as our partner FlyDubai. Whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline, I would suggest you contact your private travel insurers, as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations. Nevertheless, as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion, I have credited 10,000 goodwill miles to both your Skywards accounts. Miss May, I do hope that you will continue to choose Emirates in the future.\",\n",

I thought the IFE was excellent, with some quality new releases to choose from. The meals were large and generous - I am a Qatar Airways frequent flyer, and the Emirates meals are significantly larger than those on Qatar. However, the alcohol options are far smaller on Emirates, and on both flights I was only offered a drink once per flight.

They said yes due to a stop longer than 13 hrs the airline must provide accommodation for you but they didn’t have access to the hotel booking system and asked us to address this issue in emirates airline counter in Dubai airport. We arrived in Dubai and asked about the hotel booking option. Surprisingly they said we cannot have any accommodation provided by airline, and it is not their problem! We had arguments about the airline policy and they were refusing to show us the policy and just giving us some wrong information that it is in their policy and they cannot provide accommodation. After 2 hrs of discussion and argument, they finally provided a twin room for three people. We were really disappointed. I had a surgery on my neck about two weeks before the flight which and had to ask the cabin crew to open the head locker for me.

The first food was edible and the second one (before landing) was awful. The entertainment on my seat was broken, asking staff for help but ignored this helped. The WI-FI is free for several minutes but you must pay again after that. Last leg on DXB-CGK this is at least better than the MUC-DXB route which everything works fine.

The soup and entree was nice but the main was probably left in the oven for longer time leaving the rice very hard and the the green beans a bit burnt.

We were 8 kilos overweight between two of us and they charged us for the excess. Boarding was fine and seats comfortable but they feel a little claustrophobic. The staff were good. My wife was charmed by her attendant but I got the feeling my attendant thought she was doing me a favour by serving me. It doesn't cost any thing and takes minimal effort to smile when talking to a customer. Meals were only served within a timeslot so you couldn't eat when you wanted to and weren't really up to expectations. The champagne wasn't served cold enough. I had to return 3 glasses and in the end I went to the bar myself to make sure. The bar itself was a bit of a disappointment but maybe we were too tired to appreciate it. The seat has an area with a selection of soft drinks which you can access yourself. Unfortunately its protective frame needed two arms to prise up and then the drinks weren't cold so I had to call for ice. The entertainment system was a bit tricky to operate and took a little while to work the IFE. The upper deck of business class probably had 100 passengers in total and felt a little overwhelming.  I felt that there were not enough attendants for the number they were taking care of. There were 4 loos between us but the loos were just a bit larger than the economy toilets and disappointing. I couldn't use one because it was too messed up. When we landed no attendant offered to help my wife with her luggage from the overhead locker but it was nice to have our own upper deck exit way. On reading through this I do sound a bit like a spoiled brat and complaining over small things. But if some airlines can get these right so why not Emirates? The entire business and first class were sold out on every leg we travelled so they have plenty of customers who are happy with Emirates product.\",\n",

You can get lucky with extremely polite and efficient staff or very unlucky with poor staff. On this trip I experienced both. When a flight attendant replies to guest complaint about the ice cold, ie. not heated food with the answer she could not know I wanted it hot, then there is something severely wrong. Within Asia you will have good staff, within Europe you won't. The new A380 is a pleasure to fly, it is more spacious and new. The second leg of my journey was on an older model, a Boeing 777-300 and that was awful. It is impossible to move, eat, sit or do anything. My worst concern was the disgusting food.  Also my folding table was dirty, so they might want to look into cleanliness. The entertaining system is marvelous, but in the older planes many gadgets do not work properly.\",\n",
       "  '364': \"  Glasgow to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates. On the GLA-DXB sector, the Boeing 777-300ER was just 11 months old, clean, tidy and with impressive IFE. We had chosen the back of the plane where the window seats are in twos and would recommend this for couples; it felt spacious and comfortable. The 3-4-3 layout of the rest of the economy cabin did look very cramped however. These seats at the back put you close to the toilets but did not find it to be an issue, however you are at the back of the queue for meals which meant I was lucky to get my choice (FA had to go and find me a chicken tandoori). The long Dubai to Melbourne sector had us in seats A and B of the 3-4-3 economy layout; this felt much more cramped and uncomfortable, and will avoid in future. The A380 was slightly older, with the older style of IFE which was not altogether functional; my partner's screen was buggy and only one headphone worked. There was not much staff could do about this except change her seat which would have meant splitting us up. The A380 had WiFi but it was so slow as to be practically unusable for anything more than sending WhatsApp messages. Food on both flights was excellent, both for me (normal diet) and my partner (vegetarian-lacto-ovo). The crew made a few soft drinks runs but could have been more frequent, particularly on the longer sector. There are complimentary beverages on Emirates but the crew seemed so busy you didn't feel welcome to order one outside the meal runs. The crew were mainly pleasant but could have been a bit more welcoming and enthusiastic, as I said above you didn't really feel overly welcome or waited upon (it's not their main job but it's nice to be looked after). Check-in staff at Glasgow were helpful, pleasant and efficient, but we were caught unawares by the strict (weighed at check-in) 7kg carry-on limit. Unfortunately our biggest issue was with some damage to my partner's case which meant that it could no longer be rolled and will need to be repaired/replaced. Emirates were initially helpful, sending me a form to fill out and asking for photos etc, but 3 weeks later we have heard nothing. In this respect Dubai-based customer service needs to improve.\",\n",
       "  '365': \"  I'm writing this review so others won't go through what went through. This airline has no accountability whatsoever. The day of my flight I was denied check in. The reason was that I had less than 6 month validity on my passport which was not required for my destination. The Emirates agent at the check-in booth told me he wouldn't let me on the flight and then offered my seat to a standby client. Because of this I missed my flight, I had to renew my passeport in less than 24h and lost 2 days stay at the hotel. I had to pay 300$+ ticket as penalty to board on the next flight not to mention the psychological distress I was put under (I have depression/anxiety disorder). I was travelling with a group and someone in my group has checked in with no problem with passport validity less than 6 months. When I contacted Emirates for refund they said the agent didn't declare the incident and put me as no show on the system although I was there in time with the group. I was told by Emirates that without the name of the agent they can do nothing about it. In short Emirates agents can freely deny you your flight manipulate the system and sell your seat to another person and you can do nothing about it.\",\n",
       "  '366': ' The booked flight was Gatwick to Wellington via Dubai and Auckland. The flight to Dubai was delayed by fog at Dubai, not Emirates fault, but no one to help us get to the right gate for the onward flight. Got on plane in time but it sat there for another 2 hours. Big rush to get from AKL intl. to domestic terminal but ongoing flight delayed for over 5 hours, no plane! The return journey was delayed at AKL by 6 hours due to tropical storm so missed connection to Gatwickat Dubai. Re routed to LHr via Rome. I have been trying to get compensation from Emirates ever since. Found out today that my airmiles for the return journey had not been credited to me either. Plane, crew, food and service is great, but their customer service is absolute rubbish, will never fly with them again.',\n",
       "  '367': \"  Newcastle to Melbourne via Dubai. Decided to pay up for business given our long flights from the UK to Melbourne. I used to fly business in BA for work but last time was over 5 years ago and this service from Emirates was in a different league. The package included car pick ups and overnight at the Dubai hotel was all excellent. The service and room aboard the A380 was the highlight with the entire top floor complete with bar/lounge and I managed to sleep and arrived and returned almost without jet lag. The seat comfort, food and service was outstanding, all flights on time and very impressive all round. In addition the Lounges were all good and we were able to shower and freshen up in Dubai - the Melbourne lounge was particularly impressive. Minor criticisms, I didn't find the film selection great and the 777 seats were not quite as good. All in all, despite the costs excellent value and service.\",\n",
       "  '368': 'Mumbai to Dubai and Emirates staff was very considerate. I was travelling with a active toddler. Dubai to San Francisco and the air hostess are least bothered. Not a sight of smile while welcoming. Young kids needs milk, is it not obvious or let parents carry them. Irony is they ran out of milk when asked for second time. In a 15 hour flight is it not reasonable for a parent to ask another serving of milk for toddler. I guess cabin crew staff needs to be trained to handle young kids and learn some patience instead of making faces. This is annoying for passengers.',\n",
       "  '369': '  Jeddah to Bangkok via Dubai. All sectors on time. Good leg room on this plane and the video on demand is excellent although screen significantly more responsive on the newer and larger product on both the DXB to/from BKK legs. Long 6 hour layover on return but meal voucher provided for basic yet adequate fayre. The exit music is irritating and becomes headache inducing very quickly; it does not provide me any euphoria. Would always fly Emirates from Jeddah as they consistently deliver. Staff 10/10 on all legs but a little overworked on the final DXB to JED sector. Free 10MB wifi superb although would not connect over India then it timed out.',\n",
       "  '370': \"  Colombo to Zurich via Dubai. The last time I flew Emirates I was quite young and overly obsessed by the greatness of its product and inflight service. However, Emirates has decided to put the past behind and embark on a poorly schemed, appalling venture of cost cutting at the cost of passenger comfort whilst still charging passengers exorbitantly. The first sector was from Colombo to Dubai. It was quite acceptable that Emirates never focused on its Asian sectors for they have extreme confidence that it's competitive pricing and brand name would get them customers inevitably. Therefore, I boarded this old 777-300, the inflight entertainment was certainly not much of a great deal on the first sector with quite limited options and by trying to handle it's terribly dysfunctional remote and put it back into its position, the wire had cut my finger. It gave me the worst airplane food ever. The crew on this sector thought were the only appealing segments of what I would call the emisery. They were attentive and kind and maintained a smile but however did not go the extra mile like the qatar airways cabin crew who were an extreme delight. Furthermore, another factor that put me off completely was how narrow and uncomfortable seats were. It was a completely disastrous 4 hours and 10 minutes. The next sector was from Dubai to Zurich with a layover of about 2 hours and 30 minutes. The layover was quite bad with basically no one willing to help us in the airport.  we boarded a brilliant A380 that was the only thing as good as they advertise. Once again a repetitive episode of rude crew and even worse food. We were promised snacks by the airline on a 6 and a half hour flight that we expected would be of some quality - we were given a tiny packet of popcorn. I will never ever fly Emirates or recommend it.\",\n",
       "  '371': '  We chose Emirates to fly Manila to Boston and then back to Manila from JFK International. Our flight to Boston was pretty good, except that my seat and my cousin\\'s seat cannot be reclined, so we weren\\'t able to sleep well, it was very uncomfortable. I think they should do something about it knowing that long haul flights are very tiring. Now, our flight back from JFK int\\'l airport to Manila, is very much a hassle . We were only told that the flight was delayed for 5 hours exactly during check in time (instead of 11:20am, it became 4:30 in the afternoon) which obviously made us upset plus the fact that nobody is explaining why it was delayed. It\\'s a good thing though that they already allowed us to check in our luggage. However we needed to line up at the Check-in counter for an hour and 30 minutes. It was also disappointing that when waiting on the line, almost all the counters prioritized the Business class passengers. The flight however had a late boarding, it was supposed to board at 3:30 but they started boarding at 4:30. Our co-passengers have become impatient. We all crowded the boarding gate. Why? No one announced what\\'s happening. I asked the ground personnel, what time are they boarding but her answer is just \"in a few minutes\". What the heck, you let us wait for 5 hours and more and you cannot tell us specific answers. And now we have to wait for 12 hours for our flight to Manila. We\\'re supposed to be back to work by tomorrow. Please give fair treatment to all your passengers. The reason for delays must be explained. ',\n",

The booking was made and fully paid for four months ago. I have been advised by curt email that I have been downgraded to business class, no mention of apology, explanation nor compensation or refund. It gets better, there seems no way of contacting Emirates in New Zealand their advertised phone number is cut off. What a shambles of an airline and we haven't even left the ground. This is how they treat premium paying clients, forget it. Book with another airline, never again!\",\n",

Even if its as per the guidelines of airline this is the first experience we faced such a value less service. We travelled several air lines including low budget, they will not add the laptop in luggage weight due to their dignity. We saw number of persons facing the same.

       "  '376': \"  Manchester to Dubai return on the new 2 class A380. The plane is basically a flying cattle market and it is obvious that Emirates are moving towards to a pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap service, except that it's not so cheap. The service from cabin crew was virtually non-existent apart from serving the meal and collecting headsets/blankets at the end of the flights. Call bells were left unanswered throughout both flights with passengers resorting to self service to get a drink. No drinks runs other than with the meal. Seat pitch and width has also been reduced downstairs compared to the 3 class A380 (no doubt to cram more seats in). Emirates service has noticeably deteriorated over the last 12 months. I used to sing the praises of EK, but not any more. Will be flying with Qatar Airways next time.\",\n",
       "  '377': \"  At Algiers airport, the lounge is lifeless.  In the plane, the power receptacle is broken on my seat but luckily no one was sitting next to me to use his. The live TV did not work and the images are distorted. The live TV displays a few frames then freezes for a minute or so before displaying more frames. I was trying to watch the football game between ManU and Chelsea. The food (we were fasting) they left by your seat and then it took another 15 minutes to bring nuts and drinks after Maghrib. I just wanted soup for Iftar. In addition, when I was asked to choose my entree, it was not available. The seat I had 11A was very noisy. Usually they distribute pouches with socks, toothbrush and toothpaste and a blind mask in addition to ear plugs which would have been helpful. After all this is business class. The only bright thing in this upgrade is that the hostesses were brilliant and even tolerated my displeasure with these inconveniences in a nice way. In any case, this is the worst business class experience flying Emirates ever. Most likely it will be my last at least on this route. This is their reply: Dear Mr Boutrid, Thank you for your correspondence of 31 May 2022 regarding Emirates flight EK 758 from Algiers to Dubai on 28 April. I am concerned to learn of your disappointment with the lounge at Algiers airport. This lounge is operated by a service provider. Regrettably, not all lounge operators have the selection of food and beverages or ambience that we offer in our Emirates Lounges. However, your feedback is noted and has been shared with the relevant team for their information. Through emirates.com we do advise customers that for technical reasons we are unable to provide Wi-Fi, mobile phone, mobile data and live television services on every flight, or guarantee a continuous service. Emirates' liability is therefore limited. However, I acknowledge that this added to your disappointment. With regard to your request for the mixed grill, we always aim to match the quantity of choices with the predicted passenger preferences. While we do our utmost to meet all passenger requests, sometimes there may be shortages of a particular meal choice due to previous passenger selection. Shortages of a particular meal are continuously monitored in order to adjust ratios accordingly for future flights. It is my understanding that got your first choice of starter (potato soup), your preferred dessert, the chocolate caramel tarte, and opted for the beef meal instead. On another note, Business Class kit bags are offered on flights over 3 hours 30 minutes that depart between the hours of 22:00 to 05:00 and on all flights over 9 hours regardless of the departure time. However, certain toiletry items are available in the lavatories for the comfort of our passengers and may also be requested from our cabin crew. I regret that you did not enjoy our product offering as much as we would have liked.\",\n",

       "  '380': \"  Barcelona to Sydney via Dubai. We found the flight attendants rude. When we were arriving in Sydney people were going to the kitchenette and collecting the arrival cards but when my husband asked for one he was told that they would be distributed soon. The cards were distributed on the other side of the cabin. We did not get a card when we asked the flight attendant we were told we don't need it now in Sydney. When we asked why the other side of the cabin got embarkation cards he then said they ran short of cards and only had the cards in Arabic Language. We then asked him why he did not say in the first place that they ran short of cards in English. He was plain rude. We were at the rear of the plane and they just did not care. Emirates pride themselves of having flight attendants from 35 countries but most of them found it difficult to smile - no customer service. The food was not edible. Will not recommend Emirates on long flights from Sydney to Dubai.\",\n",

During this period of long-waiting time, Emirates didn't make up anything for us. There was no meal voucher, no nothing. I won't rate its service as good as its reputation. It is pretty poor actually. Secondly, during my whole itinerary, I had to take shuttle for at least 4 times. It was either from flight to terminal, or from terminal to flight. It's definitely not a pleasant experience because my wife and I had to wait in a jammed, hot bus, and the transit time was long. I travel average 8-10 times a year and fly various airlines worldwide. I have never experienced anything similar before (with other airlines).\",\n",

Rest of the sectors were ok. Cabin crew on board were a hit and missed and lacked consistency in quality. Food on board was very bad. Cabin Crew and Food has been on a downward spiral out of control over the years and there does not seem to be any appetite from management to improve service. This being said, flights were reasonably close to time and IFE was not bad. Emirates is slipping and it has become obvious.',\n",
       "  '386': '  Vienna to Cape Town via Dubai. This review is about my outbound flight to Cape Town (December 19th 2018). My children and I were denied boarding our flight to South Africa due to not having their birth certificates upon check-in, even though the South African government updated the policy December 1st 2018 (which no longer requires this document as mandatory). Not only did Emirate not indicate at any time during the booking process about this law they refused to reason when I showed them South African\\'s government recent update. Due to the busy Christmas season, we were unable to fly to South African until 3 days later, missed the cruise we were to join and had to embark the ship in Namibia 6 days after the original travel date. We were meant to meet my husband on board the ship and missed out on Christmas because of this mistake. The kids were devastated. We were over EUR€4,500 out of pocket since I had to book hotels, new flights and transfers, all because they hadn\\'t updated their policies. Their customer service department is a joke as the only way I could submit a complaint was through their website online form. Their response (claiming zero responsibility and therefore denying me any compensation) was from a \"no-reply\" email address. Even after I spoke with a customer service rep over the phone I was instructed to submit a new complaint since I couldn\\'t follow up to their response email. I submitted a new complaint, correcting their false claims (that I didn\\'t have a travel letter from my husband, which I did have) and I haven\\'t heard back. My husband and I have been working in the travel & hospitality industry for 25+ years and I am extremely knowledgable in luxury customer service; this is what I do for a living. This by far is the worst I have ever experienced. I will never fly Emirates again. Oh and 4/5 checked in luggage was left behind on our return flight. We received them 2 days later.',\n",

Upon noticing this, we notified one of the stewards and even asked if we could pay for an upgrade to business class, to which he replied \"No\". We escalated the complaint to his manager on board the flight who took my email address and assured me of a refund on this particular seat.

       "  '392': \"  I'm motivated to write this critical review after multiple phone-hours with customer service agents with Emirates in the hope that others would benefit (and that Emirates would listen!). We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes. All I received were platitudes such as, 'we understand', 'that is awful', etc. over the phone but with no real help to process our claim. Lesson learned and no more Emirates for us ever!\",\n",

       "  '394': \"  My first sector was from Madrid to Dubai. The purser on this flight was the crown jewel of the Emirates hospitality I remembered from my past travels. However she was assigned to business class whilst I was served by one crew who made my Emirates journey an utter disaster. The food on this flight was spectacular. The beef lasagna was great. The entertainment was limited compared to the newer A380s however it did have brilliant things that kept me entertained for 7 hours. Before take off I noticed that a customer who complained of a leaking AC was just shut down by a crew member who said 'cover your head for now, it'll stop after take off'. What a displeasing attitude from an airline renowned to be one of the best in the world.  At the meal service I noticed that meals run out when it comes to the seats at the back. The menu on that flight consisted of a chicken and beef option only, even though traditionally airlines of that calibre opt to offer a vegetarian option too. They had run out of the chicken option and my friend who for religious reasons does not consume beef, was forced with the beef option saying that was all they had. Whilst they refused to eat it, the crew who were called many times didn't even make a single appearance to enquire. Finally when it came to the pre arrival snack, they offered a chicken option and cheese option. The crew member just served the food without asking what I wanted. When I opened I realised I was given the tasteless cheese option. However, the passengers behind us were offered both where they had a choice.  My next flight was from Dubai to Colombo. Another unpleasant journey with the unsuitable comportment of the cabin crew. One of them refused to pour a full glass of apple juice for my father. \",\n",

       "  '397': '  London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai, returning to Newcastle via Dubai. London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn\\'t switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn\\'t a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn\\'t really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as \"Final Call\". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there\\'s complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777\\'s is horrific. Staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt, especially when things go wrong. All in all there doesn\\'t seem to be any benefit of flyng Emirates anymore - other carriers do this better now.\\r\\n',\n",
       "  '398': '  Newcastle to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai . I have flown with Emirates on and off for years, and you can really see cost cutting and staff attitudes changing, on my flights anyway. Their bar service is non existent more or less, you get offered a drink with your meal, and thats about it, if you want a drink of anything you have to keep ring for service, which most folk like myself dont like to do. No hot towels on getting on the craft, your just left, food has notably gone down in quality too! On the second leg of the flight, it was a 4.20am takeoff, we were left without so much as a drink of water for 3 hours, i had medication to take and asked them for water, , they must have a water shortage! It was brought in an eggcup size cup. Eventually got brought a substandard breakfast, which has been so chilled its lost all its flavour, no alcohol offered on this flight. The service has massively changed, you can really see it is like the staff cant be bothered, just wanna chuck the food at you, so they can rest and talk in the galley. I paid £700 for my flight and felt ripped off, it would put me off travelling with them again. However, it is very handy from Newcastle upon Tyne to get a bit further afield, come on Emirates, get your act together! One positive is the IFE, very good.',\n",
       "  '399': 'A nightmare journey from Dubai to Cape Town with Emirates. Poor seating, very cramped, air crew unfriendly. Captain spent 5 mins telling us that the crew were award winning. I was last off the flight as I was pretty loaded up, no help from the staff as they stood watching me. Would never fly this airline again.',\n",
       "  '400': ' We are terribly concerned and quite upset with both the quality and quantity of the onboard meals on long distance Emirates flights. In our recent experience, there was only one meal served during our flight from Manchester to Dubai which lasted for 7 hours 30min. A tiny packet of pretzels was provided as a snack which was very inadequate and compares poorly to any other airline. There were also no sleeping kits provided which is highly unusual. On the Dubai to Kolkata flight (duration of 4 hours), the only meal provided came very late and we had to request for snacks (which were tiny packets of savoury mix) to fill in. Not to mention, the meals they provided in both flights were frugal and by far of a poor quality in comparison to any standard airline. Desserts were horrendous. We dread boarding our already booked return flight back to Manchester.',\n",

The Emirates check-in was very good and answered our questions about our onward flight when arriving in Dubai further connection which was with Qantas to regional airport. We were surprised when given all three boarding passes for continuation to final destination with Qantas Chose aisle seats C/D as far back as possible. Flight was excellent with multilingual crew and co pilot Australian Captain from El Salvador. Always fly to & from to Europe with Emirates well looked after and the best gluten free meals. Arrived on time.',\n",

I booked my exit seat ahead of time and paid an additional charge of $150USD per way for the seat only to find out that the seat closest to the exit door not only had no window and felt very claustrophobic, but the seat itself was smaller and tighter then all the other seats. On top of all this the seat itself was defective as it would not recline and stay reclined. When I told the pursuer of this issue he said he will refund my money and file a complain but i neither received any refund nor did he show me any filling of any formal complaint. Actually i never saw him again throughout the whole 9 hour flight. At the Duty free airport in Beirut I had purchased some food stuff and other items  to hand carry to dubai. When i was boarding the flight from Dubai to the Manila a man stopped me and asked me to weight my hand carry, he said that the hand carry was acceptable since I already brought it from Lebanon but my Duty free items which weighed 7 Kg more was to be charged an additional $35 USD per kilo totalling $245 addition charge.  No one said that if you buy anything from Duty free you will be charged for additional weight.',\n",

I must say Emirates is way better than all, and exceeded my expectation. Seating quality, leg space, TV screen, selection of movies and tv shows, food all are fantastic. As of now, this is the best airline so far. This was the fifth time I was flying with this airline, and I will continue with them. Also, connecting in Dubai airport is easy. Security screening is very fast and convenient. The airport itself is amazing, so if you're flying with Emirates and transiting here in Dubai, you're in great hands!\",\n",

London to Dammam via Dubai, I had to stop over in Dubai for a couple of days for a family matter (I’m a GCC citizen so I don’t need a visa to Dubai). On the Emirates disk in LHR, I requested to have my luggage checked into DXB but I was told that I can’t do this because my ticket doesn’t allow a stop over unless I pay an upgrade of 2000 US Dollars or I can request my luggage once I arrived to DXB and I will be able to take them so this is what I did. When I arrived to DXB, I requested my luggage to be off the airplane and was told to wait for 2 hours to be able to collect my luggage. But when I came back to them after 2 hours they told me that the luggage are taken out of the aircraft but I can not take them unless I pay the 2000 Dollars, I tried to explain to them that I had to end my trip in Dubai and I need my stuff and my medicines from the bags but they refused.  I left the luggage with them . When I returned back home (DMM) I claimed my luggage and had them delivered after 2 days to DMM. Decided not to use Emirates again. ',\n",

Seat would not stay in one position, every time I moved the seat reclined. Interesting the cabin crew tell you seats must be in an upright position for takeoff, if it IS broken they don’t care! Had two broken seats in two flights. Customer services don’t care unless you are what they want (Business and First class). Not wasting any more money on them when you can get a budget flight at a fraction of the cost and the same service.',\n",
       "  '409': ' Hong Kong to Bangkok. Departure delayed by an hour due to a technical fault which could not be fixed with another Emirates A380 due to fly HKG non-stop to DXB three hours 25 minutes earlier. Some passengers from that flight were transferred to ours. But why that should have resulted in a lengthy delay to our flight beats me and was never explained. As a result we had to sit on board for over an hour before push-back. Once again I found the revised upper deck layout with 100 or so Y passengers in front of business class especially annoying, this time with what seemed like a major raucous party taking place just a few rows in front of my seat. Having travelled for much of the day and connected in HKG, I found it impossible to relax, the more so as the plane was being refuelled and the lighting full on. How come refuelling took place after the scheduled departure time given that our aircraft had arrived in HKG several hours earlier? Although hungry, I skipped dinner as midnight was just too late for me. All I wanted was try and sleep but even that was difficult with the short flight time. I appreciate that technical issues do occur and I felt sorry for those who had to be involuntarily rerouted via BKK and would as a result arrive late in DXB by six hours or more. For those of us who had elected to take the Bangkok flight, though, this was maddening! The lack of detailed explanations was even more so.',\n",
       "  '410': \"  Singapore to Melbourne. Before boarding I was paged to see the ground staff which I did and was asked by a rude staff if I could change my exit row seat for another passenger wishing to seat as a couple. I said no. Then during the messy boarding process I was refused boarding and directed to go back to the counter to see another ground staff, I was made to wait and treated as if I had done something wrong. The staff later took my boarding pass with an annoyed look clicked on her computer and handed back to me without a word. No explanation, no apology nothing such rudeness in the way they treat passengers. On boarding the aircraft witness an angry passenger who wanted my seat apparently and made a fuss to the cabin crew and chief Steward. She was a lone passenger so it appears that the ground crew lied about a couple wanting to sit together. Why should I be inconvenienced at the expense of others - am I not a passenger worthy of some dignity and respect? The service on this flight was at best sloppy and the crew seemed unpolished. Some were though to be fair so forgivable. But after the main course served the crew disappeared until time for a small second meal prior to landing which was a cold muffin and cold roll for breakfast - really bad! No orange juice, the crew just said don't have and that was it. No water runs between meals. Before landing crew collected the blankets and started to drag them around passengers and dumped into the toilets! Overall an average mediocre flight, crew service not very professional. I was so tired and exhausted from this flight. Emirates is dropping in standards.\",\n",

Considering how very hardworking the cabin crew are, they were cheerful, friendly and caring. The ground staff at Taoyuan airport were particularly well organised.',\n",
       "  '412': '  Madrid to Male via Dubai. I have never flown Emirates until last October 27 in a holiday trip with my wife to Maldives. Madrid to Male was nothing special: economy seats have average pitch, ICE system works fine and movies selection is huge apparently. Service onboard was quite bad, food was average, flight attendants were rude, the purser spent the whole flight shouting at the crew. They never asked if we wanted more bread or more cafe etc. The flight from Dubai to Male was scheduled at 3:15 am, so we wanted nothing but sleep. Even if we put on all of our \"resting stuff\" the flight crew woke up us at 5 am for breakfast. She said that she must assure that everyone on board was offered breakfast. On our return flights we found another surprise. As the travel agency gave us the booking reference two months ago I purchased the seats, as the fare the agency took did not allow to choose seats. I paid 140€ for the seats. So far so good until we checked in at Male airport. Our seats were changed with no reason. In both flights (MLE-DXB and DXB-MAD). The handling staff could not tell me any reasonable reason, and the finished with a great \"ask Emirates staff when you arrive to Dubai\". Great answer from a professional employee. But when I tried to get an explanation at Dubai my luck did not get better: after twenty minutes trying to hold a conversation, one person who supposedly was in charge gave me a piece of paper with a web site written and told me to fill an online claim. Great airline, great staff, great service. Onboard more of the same: bad service, rude crew, poor food and added to my other trip: my entertainment system did not work. Luckily I had my ipad with lots of stuff loaded. This was my first and my last trip with Emirates.',\n",

I had an extra luggage and the staff made me spend 2 hours re arranging and arranging the bags, the finally told me to trash one bag and to my surprise they still charged me $300 for extra kgs.

       "  '414': '  Dubai to New York JFK. The service was very good, the crew was efficient and responsive. The condition of the toilets was very, very poor. The number of passengers using the toilets warrants that someone clean the toilets, including the floor, at regular intervals during a 13 hour flight. It is not sufficient to clean only before and after a flight. I realize crew may not see this as within their job but there is something off kilter about handing out scented warm towels, booties and toothbrushes but expecting passengers to use filthy toilets.',\n",
       "  '415': ' Our flight was amazing from start to finish. I always fly Emirates because of the fabulous hospitality. Both legs of the flight were fantastic. A staff member on our second leg of the journey from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur on the 6 Oct - EK 0344 gave us special treatment on the flight as it was my daughter’s 9th birthday. My kids were given a special cake in a lovely glass presentation with Polaroid photos to take home for memories. This staff member is the true face of Emirates service with a smile and amazing hospitality. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!',\n",
       "  '416': '  I always travel by Emirates and liked it but this was my first time traveling with my 14 months old baby. The seat I got was too small to fit us both. I didn’t know I have to carry my baby even when he’s asleep. I asked for bassinet and they said if baby’s legs are not straight while lying in bassinet then it’s not for the baby. I had to carry him throughout the flight because he was mostly asleep. When they provided me meal I couldn’t open my table as while holding baby table couldn’t be opened. I barely ate a little and gave up. Meal for baby was also not provided although it was included in the ticket. It was a huge disappointment. I couldn’t use inflight entertainment either for baby because there was no room.',\n",
       "  '417': \" EK020, 26/01, Evening flight, easy good check-in but soon became aware afternoon flight had been cancelled so they were amalgamating flights. A380 gate at MAN is always hard work but this was totally chaotic with ground staff failing to get a grip. We queued for 20 mins to board but found we were in the wrong queue, the one to get reallocated from the cancelled flight. This was because staff failed to tell anyone what was going on. 90 mins late we took off, full flight. It was ok but the number of babes in arms crying meant no sleep, food was the usual but due to being full it was slow. On arrival we were all herded without announcement for an additional no option PCR test which was also chaotic, although it was free. Return flight EK19 on 10/02 was better serviced, on time and food was better but yet again the crying babes meant no sleep whatsoever. Bottom line is the A380 gate at MAN is still not fit for purpose and because of the popularity of those with very young children we won't be rushing back.\",\n",

Emirates are excelling with their food, compared to last year. Dubai to Auckland A380 as good as you will get in economy. Plenty of space, and so quiet in this magnificent aircraft. Service a wee bit patchy. Had a few young, I would say, new staff. However they tried very hard, and everyone has to start somewhere.',\n",

There could be not enough staff but they seem to be in a rush to go at the back and chat together. they don't seem dedicated to their work.

Food was great, service was prompt and crew were friendly. Enjoyed this flight alot.',\n",
       "  '421': '  Perth to Manchester via Dubai, returning from Paris. We have traveled with Emirates Business Class many times in the past and although not perfect, we have never had cause for complaint until now. We traveled to Manchester from Perth on 4th September 2017. Our flight to Manchester was uneventful. However, the walk (including train) to our connecting flight (EK19) was horrendous. It took at least 30 minutes to get from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1. Considering there is no significant layover time between flights, if the incoming flight from Perth had been delayed, we would have missed the Manchester flight. Another passenger who was also on the same flights looked quite ill from the strenuous walk. Many UK ex-pats live in Perth and would have been connecting to the Manchester flight, why was this flight from Terminal 1 and not terminal 3? The experience on our return flight flights was even worse. The service and food on the flight from Paris to Dubai from 30th September 2017 (EK76) was unacceptable. Food was cold (soup) and a steak that I ordered was uneatable. I asked for a glass of wine with my dinner and this did not materialise until 30 minutes after I had finished my meal. Seats were also very uncomfortable. Once again a walk and train for our flight to Perth (EK424). When the flight was eventually called we were subjected to being herded on a bus for a 10 minute drive to the plane and then had to climb a staircase to board. I have had a better embarkation experience with AirAsia and this is totally unacceptable for an airline of Emirates reputation. The flight arrived in Perth over an hour late, obviously due to the embarkation process. With the exception of the return flight from Dubai to Perth (EK424) food on all other sectors was mediocre at best and unacceptable at worst. The business class lounge in Dubai was as useful packed to the rafters and quite uncomfortable. The highlight of the flight was the food and service in the Emirates Paris Business Lounge. It is a shame that Emirates cannot maintain this consistency of service and cuisine across all flight services. We travel Business Class to Europe at least once every year and more often than not with Emirates. Given the above experience, it will be hard to choose Emirates as our carrier in the future.',\n",

Not all of us can fly business across continents, and with the reviews I read on Emirates, I thought this would be the best option to travel to SFO in Economy. It's an A380 and the flight was extremely uncomfortable. Every inch was used and leg room was not considered, I am not a tall person! The food was below standards, and I can compare with many airlines, the cabin smelt unacceptable, over booked and way too many carryons to find a space for my own! I travel a lot and have experienced many airlines. It's a shame really that all this hype was for nothing. The A/C was visually clean, as were the restrooms, service was not too bad and the entertainment is what made me survive the flight. I was thoroughly disappointed, and will not be doing that again.\",\n",

To our surprise at boarding both our tickets have been upgraded to Business Class. My first ever Business Class Experience. Loved the whole journey to Bangkok.

They have false reassurance that someone will assist me with my connecting flight which is just 1 hour and 30 minutes apart. I was desperate because even the checkin service staff on my connecting flight did not know where I’m supposed to go. She was even rude and unapproachable. And on top of it all, I am still missing with one luggage. When I got into the luggage desk they were all sarcastic. I have been travelling a lot and I have never been so badly treated like this before. Very lousy service. I’m very disappointed and so devastated because I still am waiting for my luggage. From the stress that I have that I’ll miss my connecting flight in Dubai to Heathrow since I checked in in the Philippines, to the handling of my luggage I am extremely dissatisfied.  I was really expecting good service since the ratings I’ve seen and read about the airline was good but, the opposite, it’s really the worst flight I’ve ever been to in my entire life far more worst than domestic flights I had.',\n",

I asked them why I never got any text or email update and they blamed it on the passengers. So I asked her to verify my phone number. When I got to the airport I checked on the app about the flight details and till that time it showed on time. They never even bothered to change that.

I want to call because I want to let them know I have put in my effort and you can just say a no so I can please them\". This is humiliating. On the flight, the seats were the tightest I have met in economy class. The highly rated ICE system was a joke - they claimed to have over 3000 hours of inflight entertainment but in fact, most movies were the unpopular or old ones. The so called free wifi allowed you for 10 minutes of messaging only.  The food is ok, but nothing to cry for. The crews were mostly impolite, and even for the polite ones, not proactive to help on anything. We had a tight connection (1 hour which we need to collect our bags and recheck again) and asked if we could be seated to the front of the aircraft for quick disembarkation. One of the crews ignored our requests and the one other one just said, \"oh, do it on your own\". This is the most horrible flight I have had with international flights!',\n",

It felt like a budget flight. On the return flight ground staff had poor customer service. I wanted to buy an extra bag at the airport but they insisted on charging me overweight which amounted to £500 and resulting me in leaving my belongings in the UK. Inflight service was poor. Again cabin crew are rarely in sight. The second leg the snack was so dry I spat it out. Also not to mention no cabin crew was bringing out water for the flight. Overall an incredible letdown. Never flying this route again and Emirates isn’t worth the hype.',\n",

Inflight the flight attendants seemed to treat passengers with genuine hospitality: for the first time, felt that the bar at the back of business class cabin was a good place to relax. The food was great and good wine selections. The business class seats could be a bit narrow for some people (including myself), and the in-flight Internet offering is far from satisfactory. In-flight Internet could be purchased at $16.99 for a 6-hour flight (excluding take-off and landing the Internet would only be provided for ~4 hours at most) and streaming would still be blocked.',\n",

Really bad food on the flights - so much so that for much of the flight I stayed hungry. I am not particularly finicky about food. This is not an issue with Dubai to India (shorter flight) but a real issue for SFO to DXB. On this occasion I swapped my Business class seat with my wife's economy class. Extremely rude staff, started an argument whether I can visit my wife in business class. This was lodged as a complaint with Emirates but I did not hear anything in the last 3 months. So rude staff, and ineffective management that does nothing even on feedback. Wife was pregnant and unwell, threw up on the flight in the Business class seat and requested that I be called from the economy section for a few minutes.

On a scheduled 11 hour flight from Athens, not once except with meals were refreshments offered, including water, and beverages, etc. This was a flight during daylight hours so the cabin crew did not have a reason to not offer drinks. When a person requested a beverage it was obvious that the cabin crew was annoyed with the request, even though their ads on the inflight entertainment was stressing to stay hydrated during the flight. This was just the opposite of our experience on Singapore airline where the cabin crew came through about every 30 minutes offering drinks, sandwiches, fruit and candy bars including Toblerone candy bars.

Maybe expectations were too high, but this experience was just not as good as Emirates promotes itself (best airline? Really?) The aircraft was not new and a few seats were damaged. The cabin was not clean. The staff were not friendly, and once they totally ignored my request for assistance. Entertainment system was not very handy: the touchscreen was not working properly on both flights, so I had to use an old and an uncomfortable joystick. I didn't like the selection of movies, either - there were many movies in the database (including Asian, Bollywood etc) but all of the Western movies were more or less of the same genre. Same with TV shows. The dinner was very good, however, only one real meal on a long haul flight was not sufficient (only an old sandwich was given before landing). There were no snacks or beverages in between. No amenity kits provided. There was wifi onboard; 2 hours free. On a positive note, you can check-in 2 bags, 32 kg each. Overall, it was all okay because Emirates flight was the cheapest one among all flights available for this route and date. I would be very disapointed otherwise, though.\",\n",

I visit them yesterday 9th July and to my surprise, I heard that there was a repatriation flight that left a day before which was on the 8th July and also another one is scheduled for 14th July meanwhile I called and kept calling and even use their chat platform just to let me know if there is any repatriation flight to Nigeria, but seems all the customer care I spoke with were poorly informed, how can you as a customer care or telephone operator or ticketing officer and you don\\'t know there is a repatriation flight just to inform your clients. The biggest shock of my life was the lady at the ticketing office on 8th July around 2 pm -5 pm she shouldn\\'t be working as a customer service personnel at all, she is badly mannered, she does not display any form of empathy all, I explained my situation to this lady and what she said was \"all flights for July has been cancelled and it\\'s not only you\". My point is if you cancelled my flight and I already told them my situation why cant they just inform me that theren is a repatriation flight they just displayed a nonchalant attitude, meanwhile i have been following up with their flight for more than a month and several repatriation flight left and still non of them informed their customers about this, they are only happy to cancel your flight taking advantage of the situation without even informing of the next and available options for their customers. Till now I have not been able to get any ticket and I have to leave Dubai this month July, 2020 unfailingly and I heard there is a repatriation flight for 14th July still they have not been able to put me on this flight despite my condition.

Once boarded, we didn\\'t see them again till we were served a meal. About an hour or so before we landed I asked one FA about landing cards to fill in. She said they had run out of them as they \"never give us enough\" and we would probably have to fill in once we landed however to her credit she called around and found a pile more. Not sure why this wasn\\'t done when they had run out earlier? Anyway that was sorted. They also asked for coin donations to a children\\'s fund, so we had our coins ready but no one came for them. Just odd. The PE was quite good though but as for service, I\\'d say below par compared to most airlines I have flown.',\n",
       "  '444': '  Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. Having a stopover at Dubai now enroute to London. Decided to check on why Emirates was below expectation. Initially wanted to keep my experience to myself but not after reading Skytrax reviews on Emirates. First and foremost, I was allotted the worst seat anyone can get. Seat 66H,  the lavatory seat. Wrote to Emirates 3 days back, I am in Dubai now, my flight is done, but no response from them. Luckily upon online check-in, I decided to change my \"aromatic\" seat - and I had to pay extra for a different seat. Emirates should not sell or make money from this row of seats. Esp when there are still empty seats on the flight for sale or seat change for extra payment. Its downright unacceptable and disgusting from a country that prides itself to be super rich operating the 2nd largest A380 fleet. I know now, I was fooled by all of Emirates advertisements and their perceived image. On to the flight, the flight was below expectation. Economy class cabin crews\\' attention and attitude got heaps to improve. Giving me the immediate impression that Emirates only crave and care for Business and First Class passengers attention, I guess Economy class passengers are only herds of cattle to them. The food was bland and presentation was poor. And the Emirates A380 economy seat is very uncomfortable Someone should remind Emirates management, that Economy class service ultimately differentiates an airline from its competitors and generates the most revenue for any airline Anyone wants to fly Emirates? fly Business or First, never Economy.',\n",

I like Emirates' consistent level of service. Their pricing remains sharp, they really connect the world. Not to forget their excellebt webiste: so easy to manage one's booking, reserve seats, upgrade using miles. Food the only item to improve.\",\n",
       "  '447': '  Dubai to London. Emirates has to follow international standards. We were delayed for 45 minutes. Not a single explanation or word of apology was given by the captain. This is unacceptable. We arrived in London 22 minutes late and not a word of comment. Just \"It\\'s a nice sunny morning in London.\" This approach to ignoring the delay is absurd. Do they think if they say nothing, the problem doesn\\'t exist. Emirates has to learn how to be punctual or learn how to apologise for delays.',\n",
       "  '448': ' Unforgettable experience flying with Emirates from Singapore to Rome via Dubai. I was booked on flight EK433, with scheduled departure on Friday at 9.35am but was notified last minute via text message at 4.23am that I had been put on EK353 departing at 10.10am instead. To make things worse, that flight was delayed for another 1 hour 10 minutes. I didn’t know if I was traveling with Emirates or a budget airline that cancels flights on a whim. By the time I arrived in Dubai, my original 2 hour connection time had become less than 40 minutes. Ground staff in Dubai did not offer any form of assistance in making my connecting flight. I made it to the departure gate 5 minutes before closing time only to be told I had been offloaded from the plane. At no stage was I notified that I would be bumped from my connecting flight because of shorter than “minimum connection time” thanks to Emirates’ brilliant incompetence in punctuality. After some argument with the ground staff at the gate, I managed to get onto the flight with the supervisor granting me an act of grace, when it’s Emirates which had sinned. But his grace did not extend to my checked in baggage however, which will only arrive with the next flight. Arrangement to make delivery of my delayed baggage was made immediately after clearing immigration on arrival in Rome FCO airport Friday at 6.40pm, when I was assured my luggage would arrive following day. I even received an email saying my bag will arrive in Rome at about 12.40pm on Saturday. Little did I know I would be slapped in my face with Emirates’ commitment to punctuality again. When I haven’t received my bag at 5pm, I rang the baggage office, and was advised it had just cleared customs and would be delivered in the evening. 6 hours later I was still waiting, and followed up with another less than pleasant phone call. Upon which, the only solution they could offer is the contact number of the local baggage delivery agent. No, of course their gilded fingers can’t possibly dial the number to follow up on a customer’s delayed baggage. I finally received my bag on Sunday at 12.15am. Hooray for a change of clothes finally. No one from Emirates throughout this ordeal acknowledged their fault nor offered compensation for me to get a change of clothes and toiletries. Hello Tomorrow? More like Hello Never.',\n",

Used to fly Emirates and the services was pretty good so we went back to Emirates. Both Qantas and Jestar was ok too but this whole codeshare thing had really ruin our family trip. Ticketing was not transferred properly from one airline to the other airline and we have had to scrumble to find our own way. When customer purchased a ticket from one airline their expectation is solely to that particular airline. Otherwise we could have chosen other airlines. Nearly missed our flight. Treated poorly at counter and was told it was ticketed by another airline so we didn't get to choose seats, food or nothing at all. Essentially a subclass customers. We did not know nor had chosen Qantas and Jestar. Not once heard of Emirates other than paying more and handed to other airline including a budget airline.  We have had to carry our infant on hand despite empty seats are available. It was horrible.  Totally unacceptable.\",\n",
       "  '451': '  London to Dubai. After my daughter and I being upgraded to business as a surprise we entered the cabin very excited. The staff were amazing, my husband and I had been allocated seats apart and although not a major problem for us our stewardess went out of her way to re-seat us once everyone had boarded. Food was superb as was choice of drinks. The seats are individual pods and mattresses offered out as a night flight. We were too excited to sleep but the staff were so friendly and we enjoyed spending time in the bar area and talking to the crew. Obviously travelling business class is going to be an amazing experience but the staff just made it complete. I would just like to say I took the same route in December and was perfectly happy with the whole flight. Leg room good as was food and although the drinks trolley runs are no longer very regular the staff are more than happy to get you something if you ask. Well done Emirates we will definitely be using you again.',\n",
       "  '452': \"Booked to fly from New Delhi to Accra via Dubai in business class with Emirates in Aug 2015 with a layover of 1 hr 20 mins in Dubai. The flight from Delhi took off 30 mins late and then circled Dubai before landing in a remote corner of the airport. We rushed and reached our boarding gate (20 mins before departure) just as the last of the economy passengers were boarding. We were denied boarding on the pretext that we were late at the gate - never mind that there was no one to receive us at the terminal, Emirates flight from Delhi was late and that last few passengers were still boarding right in front of us. Staff at the gate were rude, turned us away and asked us to get our re-routing from the Emirates customer service. With 2 kids who were sleepy and exhausted, we made our way to a long queue at the customer service counter. They routed us to Accra via Abuja and on my husbands persistent query assured us that Abuja had transit facilities. The situation in Abuja was far from this - no transit, we were made to collect our bags by paying for passenger trolleys, re-check in at Arik Air and fight customs / immigration who insisted on stamping our passports. The Arik Air flight was delayed, there was no business class lounge at the airport and the flight itself was a small propeller aircraft. We were happy to reach Accra in one piece after the harrowing experience. On registering a complaint with Emirates we were advised that they would investigate and needed 30 days - at the end of this period they came back with no admittance of guilt but offered us 15,000 frequent flyer points each which to date they have not credited to my children's account. Contrast this with our recent experience on Eithopian where we were transported from the tarmac when they were late on a flight from ACC to NBO and even connected our bags. Did not expect Emirates to treat business class passengers in this manner. They clearly are now such a big airline that they could not be bothered by these exceptions - imagine how they treat non-gold, economy class travelers - am glad to see other airlines now catching up with them.\",\n",
       "  '453': \"  London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion. I have flown with Emirates since the late 90's and had not used them recently. I decided to use them this year. What a shock! This was not the Emirates that I used to know and liked immensely. Their aircraft are dirty and their staff, both on the ground and in the air, are inept and downright rude. In my particular case, i originally booked flights from Gatwick to Manila, via a two hour stopover in Dubai. After paying for the flights, Emirates emailed me to say that the schedules had changed and I was now on a flight from Heathrow with a one hour stopover in Dubai. To be honest, i was somewhat wary of such a tight connection time but I (in hindsight) stupidly trusted Emirates to get me to my destination on time. Well, the inevitable happened. The flight from Heathrow was delayed, thus causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila. Incidentally, having checked this particular flight (EK004), it appears that it has been late departing from Heathrow virtually every evening. I would love to know how many other Manila bound passengers have missed their connection in this way over the last three months. The Emirates ground crew at Dubai were next to useless, accommodating us in a shabby hotel in Dubai for a few hours and then sticking us on a Hong Kong bound flight that evening, to connect with a Philippine Airlines flight the following morning. In short, a planned 17 hour, 1 stop journey became a 30 hour, 2 stop journey. I contacted Emirates and asked why we had not been placed on the direct flight from Dubai to Manila that evening. We would have still been late, but at least we would not have had to connect in Hong Kong. As yet, no answer. In fact, the response from Emirates has been condescending and wholly unsatisfactory. The Dubai ground crew and the Emirates customer service office give the impression that they are doing the delayed passengers a huge favour by shipping them out on a little bus to a Dubai hotel for a few hours and then placing them on later, non-direct flights. The customer services rep in his email to me even had the brass neck to point out how expensive it is for Emirates to re-book us on to another airline at Hong Kong.  Here's an idea Emirates, stop re-scheduling passengers on to flights with almost impossible connection times and get your passengers to their destinations as advertised. In conclusion, we missed a late evening meet up with friends in Manila and I had to fork out £160 for new internal flights to our final destination, as we had missed our original flights in Manila. Any potential Emirates passengers out there, read these reviews and take heed. Avoid the headaches and book with an airline who actually know what they are doing. I certainly shall in future.\",\n",
       "  '454': 'Sydney to Dublin via Dubai, and Emirates have an average to good business class product. Flew both legs on 777 with only issue being the seats are angled lie flat which was a disappointment. Food was good with large portions on both legs, good selection of wines and spirits. Excellent AVOD with the largest selection of movies I have seen on an airline. Staff on both legs were both professional and friendly. ',\n",
       "  '455': ' After a pleasant stay in the lounge at Dubai airport, it is a nice start to the long flight being able to board directly onto the upper deck without having to go down to the main terminal level so even though they may be boarding 80 passengers it always feels a little more civilized. It is a long but pleasant flight on the great A380, plenty of room and storage with the window seats on the upper deck. Another great crew and service and again the onboard bar is a big hit and the staff who take turns at the bar always seem friendly. Two full meals are served on this long flight a lunch and breakfast with a light snack in between with a good variety of snacks available at the bar. Emirates has a good entertainment system on all their flights with something to keep everyone entertained even on a long flight.',\n",
       "  '456': '  I had a flight from Bangkok to Paris (France) via Dubai. The transit was supposed to last 1h 30. With a 1-hour delay announced on the first flight (warning received by email a few hours before check-in), I thought the transit would be tight to be held. Contradictory information was given on the airport and by mail. We asked the ground staff, all they could say to us is \"no\". When finally our flight took off with a 2-hour delay, we thought we could not make it. Onboard, the crew did not want to listen to one single word from the passengers. All they could say to us is \"no\". When landing at Dubai, talking to the ground staff was of no use : all they could say to us is \"no\". So we ran to the boarding counter of the next flight. The plane was here, but we could not get inside. We waited 2 hours in Bangkok airport and the plane could not wait 15 minutes for the passengers to board, resulting in a final delay of 15 hours. We finally reached Paris the day after. Fortunately we could spend the night in a hotel. And we could get the final flight the day after, where all the blankets were gathered in front of emergency doors. And of course with a delay. Emirates, never again.',\n",
       "  '457': ' Dubai to Düsseldorf. Again a great flight with Emirates. We had a great experience on that flight. The service was great, after departure we got snacks and drinks.

       "  '458': '  Appalling customer service from Emirates. All good from London to Dubai, but then we were told we were not booked on the flight from Dubai to Brisbane as it was over booked and they needed someone to take another flight. We had booked this flight and our seats 6 months before. So after an hour arguing with them we were permitted to fly but were given alternative seats next to the kitchen. Subsequently we could not sleep because of the noise plus my entertainment system was dead. I complained 3 times and was told they would reboot it but it never happened. So on my return I contacted customer service and was informed my it would take 30 days to look into my complaint. Here we are 52 days later and not another word. All in all very poor and disappointing service from Emirates.',\n",

The waiting line is also quite unorganized with no supporting staffs maintaining order. Nonetheless, I was able to check in my luggages and headed to the boarding gate with no big problems. Seating comfort on the economy class in B777 and food quality are above average. The entertainment screen works fine. No delays on departure. I may not want to fly Emirates in the future.',\n",
       "  '460': '  Emirates has been using the 777 to serve HKG ever since the start of the pandemic, it used to be the A380. The 777 has a strange business class configuration of 2x3x2. Who wants to be the unlucky fellow to sit in the middle of the 3, paying premium price? The service is OK but not great either. Food was as bland as ever, the seat is really narrow and uncomfortable. OK for a short to medium haul flight up to about 6 hours, anything longer than that would be an ordeal. Still, one redeeming grace is that, they sell this short leg at a very attractive price, so that is acceptable.',\n",
       "  '461': '  Boarding fast despite seemingly full airplane. FA good and attentive. Departure delayed by 30 minutes. Outdated seat you need to press button 100 times to go to flat. Food quality is average. Internet not working, I have to spend time trying and trying. Bathrooms are clean however it was at the back of the airplane, front bathroom kept for first class, and every time i went i found 3-4 waiting, Toothbrush not available.',\n",
       "  '462': '  Kuwait to Amman via Dubai on 3rd July 2019. If you ever depart from Kuwait and are flying Emirates, I’d strongly suggest using online check-in. At KWI, Emirates has a separate counter for online check-in passengers thus enabling passengers to skip the queue and proceed directly to the counter without having to wait. Be aware that during online check-in, you will not receive e-boarding passes if departing from Kuwait. I contacted Emirates and was told this is not an issue. At the counter, I received the boarding passes for both flights EK 856 (KWI-DXB) and my connecting flight EK 903 (DXB-AMM). The check-in experience was smooth, and within 10 minutes, I was through to immigration and security. Online check-in if departing from Kuwait is a lifesaver! First leg EK 856 from Kuwait to Dubai on the B777-300 ER. Boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. It was chaotic as expected for a fully-booked flight. Unfortunately, the aircraft was really old (registration A6-EBE). The screen was very small and ICE version was also very old. 3-4-3 configuration is not a favorite, and the seats felt narrow. Only 1 meal choice and no menus were given. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Kuwait due to late completion of boarding. Luckily, arrival in Dubai was only 5 minutes late despite the 30 minute delay departing Kuwait. If possible, book a seat on the left or right side of the aircraft (rows A, B, C or H, J, K). These seats will feel less cramped than seats in the middle (rows D, E, F, G). I was seated in seat 33A. Overall, a good flight although I’d avoid the EK B777 economy product all-together (unfortunately EK doesn’t fly the A380 to Kuwait so that’s not possible). Second leg EK 903 from Dubai to Amman on the A380-800. First time flying the EK A380! Again, boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. The aircraft was definitely newer (registration A6-EOU). ICE version was newer and screen was much bigger. Still a 3-4-3 configuration however much more comfortable than the 777. Just like the previous flight, no menus were given and there was only 1 meal choice. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Dubai and arrival in Amman was only 3 minutes late. I was seated in seat 78K. Baggage claim at AMM was abysmal! I wonder if the problem lies with Emirates or the baggage handling system at AMM. I can’t really give them much blame due to the fact that the aircraft was an A380, but waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for baggage delivery is still unacceptable! Also, in my opinion, Emirates should really rethink boarding times. Boarding an aircraft 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time surely guarantees a delay. On EK 856, pushback was not until 15 minutes after scheduled departure time and on EK 903, pushback was not until 13 minutes after scheduled departure time! In my opinion, boarding should begin 60 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Also, Emirates should grant its aircraft a 2-hour turn-around time slot. This would give 1 hour to clean and prep the aircraft for boarding and an additional hour to complete boarding, ensuring an on-time departure.',\n",
       "  '463': '  Flew Johannesburg to Athens via Dubai with Emirates. Flew the week (a few days) after the incident at Dubai Airport and although there were delays out of Johannesburg we managed to catch our connection to Athens the next day courtesy of efficient ground staff at Dubai Airport. Arrived on time in Athens but without luggage which was a \"pain in the neck!\" apparently due to operational issues. Fortunately we were headed directly to the Greek islands where a swimming costume is all you need. Luggage arrived within two days but Emirates flights on all sectors were a pleasure and you will use them again on my route next year.',\n",
       "  '464': '  Brussels to Dubai. There are a lot of nice items however some details should be improved. The suite in a 777 in first is extremely well designed; the wines during the flight were great including Dom Pérignon of 2008 and even a First growth Bordeaux Ch Margaux 2004. Aside of the caviar, despite Emirates still not give pearl spoons, the food could be better. For first class it was just Ok - despite the very friendly service. Emirates is very generous with the drinks in first, refills, dessert wines digestives. I did not ask for the breakfast - it was too early for me 4.30AM Dubai time. Passengers do get a pyjama and decent amenity bag. In a 777 there are 2 restrooms for a maximum of 6 people, however the space is very limited. The Belgian chocolates are replaced by some chocolates made in the UK.',\n",
       "  '465': ' I was compelled to write a review for an airline because of the exceptional service I got from the whole team of the cabin crew. It was more of a great experience rather than a journey. Right from the entrance to the aircraft I was treated like a beloved family member who came to see the family after years by every staff member. Every single request was taken seriously and was addressed to the best of the availability. I felt that I was the only special passenger for them, they were super nice and highly empathetic in their body language. The air hostess assigned to my area was asking me every single time she passed by me with a great smile if all was good. When you enter the lounge you are greeted with super smiles, if you ask them something they come close to you holding shoulders to show attachment. They were all super devoted to their work, full of energy and trying to help everyone as much they can. I am a frequent flyer of Emirates, though the maintenance inside aircraft has compromised that fresh and modern look but their crew members compensated that by miles. My special thanks and 7 star to every single staff member in the busines class cabin.',\n",

During airport procedures I was injured with a small finger cut so once we are in the air after switching off seat belts sign I pinched the attendant button, and for 40 min no one came, to the limit I went to attendants place to request band aid. I have a boy and a girl where one got served with kids food and the other not for 30 min till I stood up again and requested for the food, and the answer I was provided that “sorry the oven is broke”. I had to take the same airline traveling back to Dubai for some work and I hoped to have a different experience, once I approached the check in counter I was informed that the flight is delayed with 105 min, and the flight took off  Delayed more with 150 min.  I wrote to customer service to compensate such loss who took them 2 days to reply my complain explaining how they are aiming for best customer service and trying to be number 1 and by the end they told me nothing and no compensation. I still have 2 flights already booked with them and really this will be the last time I will think flying with such bad attitude and service.',\n",
